It\u0026rsquo;s probably the result of my meditation practice. An interesting effect of this is that therapy can feel more difficult at times. The assumption I have is that there should be a story or root-cause to my struggles, which could be true. But maybe not. The narratives are less important than what they bring up, though they are linked. What tends to be more helpful is \u0026ldquo;hitting on\u0026rdquo; an emotion. Once the emotions are felt and held the narratives become less sticky, less useful as compasses to navigate the world with, less important to hang onto. More energy naturally follows, which is maybe why I feel more present, engaged, and happier recently. I\u0026rsquo;m reminded of that Joan Didion quote: \u0026ldquo;we tell ourselves stories in order to live.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s a description of what we do to live, but Rachel Aviv correctly notes In Strangers to Ourselves that those same stories can end up trapping us, too. A lesson from history might be relevant here: we seek to understand the past so that we can focus on the present and future. Yes some of us tell ourselves stories to live, but it is not necessary to live your life as a story to have lived.\n@@@\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e@@@\ndate: 2025-01-28\ntime: 22:48\nTalked about the pressure to find purpose in therapy today, how it takes away from my exploration and enjoyment of things. Taking the example of my recent interest in Ukrainian history, what I initially felt after finishing a lecture was a kind of emptiness. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a larger sense of what my efforts were connected to, no overarching purpose other than following my curiosity. For some reason this doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem good enough to my mind. My efforts have to mean something more, according to my thought patterns. Why so? Hard to say, really. I\u0026rsquo;ve felt this purpose-pressure for so long now, mostly from myself. It\u0026rsquo;s the water I swam in, and I\u0026rsquo;m just starting to step out of it. A guess is that having a sense of purpose will resolve the pain of idleness and directionlessness I\u0026rsquo;ve felt for so long. But why is idleness and directionlessness so distressing? Why is it not enough to follow my curiosities? There\u0026rsquo;s a feeling that I have to \u0026ldquo;be somebody\u0026rdquo;, particularly somebody smart and interesting so that I can keep the attention of others. What does that attention lead to? Love I suppose. Yeah. And a sense that the way I\u0026rsquo;m spending my time matters, which is equated to productivity. I have to produce something tangible with what I consume. Ironic considering I\u0026rsquo;m learning about history and Ukraine from Timothy Snyder, who authored On Tyranny. My mind has been its own tyrant! He needs some jester energy. Serious-play. We also talked about a time when I got really heated at a party a year or two ago for holding a view that was opposite of what my friends thought. I often want to be right, or at least have my views acknowledged, even if disagreed with. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t fun feeling like an outsider. This is my own sensitivity, rather than a reflection of how my friends actually felt about me. I also hated feeling dumb, even though I knew my concerns were valid and rooted in some research articles I had read (regarding unconditional praise in a classroom setting). I\u0026rsquo;m glad I got to move through that. Otherwise I was pretty engaged today. Did some math, watched another lecture on the making of modern Ukraine, read War \u0026amp; Peace. Tolstoy actually has a sense of humor. Really peaceful day overall.\n@@@\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e@@@\ndate: 2025-01-27\ntime: 19:07\nSomething I want to continuously track: how my analytical mind often creates doubt that wasn\u0026rsquo;t present during direct experience.\n@@@\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e@@@\ndate: 2025-01-27\ntime: 18:56\nI got some good sleep last night. Today I worked out in the morning, meditated, read \u0026ldquo;On Freedom\u0026rdquo;, and started Timothy Snyder\u0026rsquo;s lectures on the making of modern Ukraine. Surprisingly I found it really interesting. The lecture touched on questions like what is history and how might you begin to understand the formation of a nation like Ukraine? There was a distinction between the objective and subjective components of history, one being related to the context (geography, policies, etc) and the other relating to a person\u0026rsquo;s personality and inner life. Both are constantly in tension and must be accounted for to understand history. Additionally there was emphasis on human agency and unpredictability. One can never predict what will happen even if you have all the information of the past, says Snyder. My motivation for the course has to do with the fact that I know someone from Ukraine. But I also find the country itself has an appeal despite not knowing much about it. It may be the understanding of a people that most interests me. Snyder later talks about the language of authoritarians like Putin and how countries like Russia use language to control people. Putin is espousing the myth that Russia and Ukraine were never separate, as indicated by the title of \u0026ldquo;On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians.\u0026rdquo; This title is subtly insidious for multiple reasons. Historical unity implies that there was a unity to begin with. Also the word \u0026ldquo;On\u0026rdquo; suggests that whatever follows exists and is real. The implication is that things could not have been different. Hence it is natural for Russia to seek reunification with Ukraine, to bring things back to the true order, \u0026ldquo;the way things should be.\u0026rdquo; Yet history is something that continuously changes; it goes against the notion of historical unity, since there is no way that anything \u003cem\u003eshould\u003c/em\u003e be. There are merely various decisions and factors at play. Nothing had to be the way it is, Snyder argues.\n@@@\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e@@@\ndate: 2025-01-27\ntime: 12:08\nHad a really nice weekend. Highlights: Dzog\u0026rsquo;chen movement, SoRA facilitator training, attention lab, hanging with Karen, reading On Freedom. I really enjoy engaging in rich, intellectual, experiential conversations. Attention is something fun to play with. What it really is involves experimentation, and seeing what happens.\n@@@\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e@@@\ndate: 2025-01-24\ntime: 12:12\nBeen really enjoying \u003ca href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/744574/on-freedom-by-timothy-snyder/\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;On Freedom\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e by Timothy Snyder. A certain degree of unpredictability is a feature of free societies, not a bug. This is because the most free people are free enough to pursue what they value most, which is inherently personal and infinitely varied. Put a bunch of free people doing this together and you will generate some chaos. This is naturally threatening to those who seek to preserve the old order. That\u0026rsquo;s not to say the old order is \u003cem\u003enecessarily\u003c/em\u003e bad, just that things are always open to change when people are enabled to be free. The opposite is a predictable society, which is essentially the same as one that is controlled, one that is dead. The youth cannot be youths, the adults stuck in stagnation.\n@@@\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e@@@\ndate: 2025-01-24\ntime: 12:06\nIt is strange to feel so rudderless. One of the questions on the NYC Zen care application asks if anything will interfere with fulfilling the nine-month commitment to the training \u0026ldquo;such as family obligations, plans for relocation, financial concerns, physical limitations, travel, professional or educational commitments, and/or other concerns.\u0026rdquo; The question I\u0026rsquo;m hung up on is plans for relocation. Right now at least, I\u0026rsquo;m feeling uncertain about staying in NYC. It\u0026rsquo;s not so much NYC, I think, as it is my sense of connectedness and commitment to any place, anywhere. I don\u0026rsquo;t feel at home \u003cem\u003ein myself\u003c/em\u003e! I don\u0026rsquo;t know what I want to choose yet! The possibility is there. It comes from simply choosing. But it is not always simple to choose. I know I don\u0026rsquo;t have to stay in NYC forever if I don\u0026rsquo;t want to. I know how I currently feel (the anchorless, lost feeling) is coloring my thoughts. Still, it\u0026rsquo;s hard.\n@@@\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e@@@\ndate: 2025-01-22\ntime: 21:13\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ve realized that learning new tech for its own sake (web dev, AI, etc) doesn\u0026rsquo;t really work for me. That\u0026rsquo;s what I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to do for 21 days. I learn better when there\u0026rsquo;s an outcome in mind, which is fine. There\u0026rsquo;s other things that capture my attention. I\u0026rsquo;ve known this for awhile, and yet I keep trying to muscle through it. Truth is I have all the tech and tools I need to know.

Back in therapy again. Felt more productive. We were on the verge on something important. I could tell because I was getting a bit choked up at the mention of some things. Jay\u0026rsquo;s good. Certain actions don\u0026rsquo;t resolve the recurring thoughts and moods. I keep learning more tech stuff like web development (not interested) and AI (no application), expecting it to, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t. I feel trapped. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what to do. My mood has been going downhill a bit. The loneliness is getting hard. Feeling really bad. Perhaps this is part of the process. Seeing what\u0026rsquo;s always been here. Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s why I stopped therapy the first time. Too painful not to have immediate resolution. I can\u0026rsquo;t run anymore.\n@@@\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e@@@\ndate: 2025-01-20\ntime: 09:32\nFelt like I had manic energy last night. Couldn\u0026rsquo;t sleep until 2am. Stayed up reading various things, ending with Sally Rooney\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/sep/22/intermezzo-by-sally-rooney-review-is-there-a-better-writer-at-work-right-now\"\u003eIntermezzo\u003c/a\u003e. Karen\u0026rsquo;s right: it is really good. The language, initially, takes some getting used to. What I mean is it\u0026rsquo;s colloquial. It sort of feels like text messages being strung together, at least in the first chapter on Peter. I think this makes it all the more relatable though. You can see yourself more easily in the story. Not that it\u0026rsquo;s difficult. I wondered though why she chose to write like this. And then I got my answer in chapter 2. The language reflects the interiority of her central characters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIvan I find relatable. I don\u0026rsquo;t think about the same things like he does, but anyone who has some degree of social anxiety mixed with an intellectual bent can probably see themselves in his mind. If EM Forster urged us to \u0026ldquo;only connect\u0026rdquo;, then Rooney explores how this is difficult, all the ways we try and fail and sometimes succeed. Language is limited; what else is being said between two people?\n@@@\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e@@@\ndate: 2025-01-19\ntime: 18:08\nIn How to Be Single and Happy the author notes that venting to others can become a deeper form of rumination. It\u0026rsquo;s a vicious cycle because you may start to believe that no one is there for you, when in fact the opposite is true. They \u003cem\u003ehave\u003c/em\u003e been there for you, hence why their limit has been reached. The focus should be to break the cycle of rumination. What helps is: recognizing that venting is not actually making you feel better (anymore), and engaging in things that bring you beyond yourself. By doing so you break the negative loops that are driving your mood, which literally puts your pain in perspective, thus making you feel better. This is different from avoiding your feelings. It\u0026rsquo;s an acknowledgement that remaining in your negative thought loops isn\u0026rsquo;t helpful, and acting in accordance.\n@@@\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e@@@\ndate: 2025-01-19\ntime: 14:26\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2025/01/17/forgiveness/\"\u003eForgiveness\u003c/a\u003e by Maria Popova.\n@@@\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e@@@\ndate: 2025-01-19\ntime: 08:37\nThe missing has begun. I was really yearning for company this morning. Sad to say that Karen was the only person I really had to share relaxing mornings with. I want to get coffee and ponder poetry with people. People who I can walk around the park with afterwards, to lazily wander the day away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis gives me an idea: I want to put up some flyers to find people to do these things with. We could meet at Balkan Grind - or anywhere, really. The point is to reflect and contemplate on a short text or poem, and to walk around and chat afterwards. I\u0026rsquo;d like to be close enough to these people to cook together, spend time together in the same household, same room.\n@@@\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e@@@\ndate: 2025-01-19\ntime: 08:35\nI\u0026rsquo;m reading a book called How to be Single and Happy (corny title I know). It\u0026rsquo;s actually solid though. There\u0026rsquo;s an emphasis on learning how to be with the difficult feelings that come up after a break-up, i.e. mindfulness. I don\u0026rsquo;t like the language of \u0026ldquo;focusing\u0026rdquo; on what\u0026rsquo;s here because mindfulness feels more like acknowledgement and release to me. It\u0026rsquo;s less active than \u0026ldquo;focusing\u0026rdquo; implies. There\u0026rsquo;s an alertness involved, and a degree of concentration, but not a strained effort. Overall though the message is clear. You can enjoy your life and be happy, regardless of your relationship status. The author offers tools to deal with common thought patterns that can lead to overly emotional reasoning, which gets in the way of this. She\u0026rsquo;s not at all arguing against emotions or relationships, just the ways that we disengage from our lives waiting for happness to arrive at some point in the future. Even then, even if Ms. Perfect arrived at your doorstep, would you be able to appreciate and cherish them? Your life doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be near perfect, but you \u003cem\u003ecan\u003c/em\u003e suffer a lot less by seizing to wait before your life can be enjoyed.

It means I can actually be there for people in a sustainable way.

I don\u0026rsquo;t need to learn how to build apps, etc. I like the idea of it, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think I like it as much as someone who\u0026rsquo;s a devoted web dev, for instance. Do I want to learn? Eh, somewhat. I know enough to fool around. But do I want to commit to mastery? Not really\u0026hellip; I just don\u0026rsquo;t enjoy web dev\u0026rsquo;ing, and that\u0026rsquo;s okay.\n@@@\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e@@@\ndate: 2025-01-06\ntime: 10:32\nLearning how to stay with the uncertainty of not knowing, while working towards knowing, is a \u003cem\u003eskill\u003c/em\u003e.

Dr. K says that the source of Reckful\u0026rsquo;s depression may not actually be clinical (it may be), but that his life is empty. Elaborating on that, he says that everything Reckful does is an attempt to escape himself. The problem is that he gets really good at what captures his interest, and then the pursuit stops. Getting good means finishing something, and returning to himself. Is that the desire to become a therapist for me? So I can focus on others and not feel what I feel? Is all of this a desire to escape my life? Hence why the fantasizing, the dreaming, the yearning but lack of desire to take real steps? Ugh. Do I not like who I am?

This friend is a practical person. He\u0026rsquo;s been this way for as long as I\u0026rsquo;ve known him. Never exactly prone to dreaminess or emotions, even though I see glimmers of a certain sadness covered by exhaustion at times. It feels like he\u0026rsquo;s in constant maintenance mode, juggling one obligation to the next ranging from his work to his relationship, toys (watches, cars, outdoor gear), and hobbies. We talked about camping and how much he desires seclusion. I gather from this that he is tired, just wants some time to rest and relax. I feel it in the way he talks - with regard towards numbers, status, etc. (Why can\u0026rsquo;t I remember exactly what he said? I want to focus in on specifics more often, point things out to people. \u0026ldquo;You know, I\u0026rsquo;ve noticed that you often talk about X in Y way\u0026hellip; do you notice that? I\u0026rsquo;m just curious!\u0026rdquo;) All of this makes me think about Henry from Howards End. He\u0026rsquo;s a business man through and through, has no sense of the romance, or maybe a glimmer of it, once he meets Margaret. She\u0026rsquo;s the one who saves him, preserves some sense of the sacred, as manifest in the way she feels when in Howards End. Forster has a clear sense of values. The text verges on the didactic at some points. But the writing is so beautiful that you can\u0026rsquo;t help but sense a truth there. And there really is a truth there. It\u0026rsquo;s a truth that my friends seem to miss. I think we\u0026rsquo;re all going through it actually, some of us more aware than others, of the loss of a certain youth, of something passing by, \u0026ldquo;time.\u0026rdquo; But time is a cover-up for everything that we haven\u0026rsquo;t yet seen. Perhaps we keep ourselves busy not to look at it, this giant wave that is coming for all of us, that we are a part of and cannot escape from, no matter how far into the woods we go.\n@@@\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e@@@\ndate: 2024-12-30\ntime: 10:30\nI\u0026rsquo;m making progress on the contemplative care application!
