from living well. Go slow.
Leave your labels at home.
Sit in the unknown
and let the silence speak.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wait. Wait a little longer. Wait
until you remember: a thing
can travel everywhere, just by holding
still.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Clear that from your mind.
Forget the existence of time.
You have all day which is
to say a lifetime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Listen. Look. Look
again until you see
nothing is everything,
everything in nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let everything find you.
Let every thing sing its song.
In the songs, a sky.
In the sky, a word.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Refugee</title><link>/poems/24-07-05-refugee/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/24-07-05-refugee/</guid><description>&lt;p>Like a berry hanging from a vine
that’s the first sign, according to
the experts. But you didn’t know it
then: back in Vietnam fruit grew
on trees and bushes. It didn’t hide
and rupture like cherries too ripe
inside your wife’s head.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even war has its starts, its survivors.
All you got was a thud and a body
choking on itself. That was when
sister and I became refugees, too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One day we told you we saw her,
going elsewhere. At last, when you
looked, you found her picking fruit
in familiar fields, welcoming you home.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Family</title><link>/poems/family/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/family/</guid><description>&lt;p>One day you called,
your voice full&lt;/p>
&lt;p>of sadness and the weight
of a history unknown to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the back of your throat
it had found a place to live&lt;/p>
&lt;p>like an allergen too familiar
with avoidance. Dad’s phở&lt;/p>
&lt;p>could cure anything.
It stewed of meat and bone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it knew nothing
of distance and blood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I learned this too late
choking on words&lt;/p>
&lt;p>across the country, trying
to support you, years later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was your decision:
You and mom weren’t talking&lt;/p>
&lt;p>anymore. I thought of her then,
alone, in front of the TV at the end&lt;/p>
&lt;p>of the day, always on,
weekends too, and Dad,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>hiding in the garage,
fixing audio devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the war was over
no one knew what to do&lt;/p>
&lt;p>so we went to war
with one another instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time it felt like
the right time to fire&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and listen&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The heart aches</title><link>/poems/23-11-01-the-heart-aches/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/23-11-01-the-heart-aches/</guid><description>&lt;p>The heart aches
for what the mind wants.
Not smart enough, nowhere close
to enlightened, a hungry snail who thinks
himself a cat, always searching,
always on the verge of something,
unable to anticipate every variable
unknown. In the end
the heart takes him in,
wraps him up in her
boundless forgiveness
knowing that puzzles
are the opiate of the restless.
She&amp;rsquo;s had the answers
all along and reminds him
as he twists and agonizes
in his sleep until sunrise, when again
he rides off toward the light,
coat fully unbuttoned, searching
for shadows on roads
that lead him
back to the beginning.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>After the party</title><link>/poems/23-10-29-afterparty/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/23-10-29-afterparty/</guid><description>&lt;p>it’s just the two of us now.
What more is there to say?
Besides, there are dishes
to do, chairs and tables
to dust and rearrange.
Oh but this you say,
this is what you’ve been
waiting for? You&amp;rsquo;re hopeless.
Didn’t you see Sherry?
Those pants! Way too tight,
gripped her body
like a banana peel.
And Tom, oh Tom,
his starving eyes,
grazing over her like a wolf.
They’d be a mess together.
Really? What a warped notion
of beauty you have.
It’s not that funny
that I notice these things.
And look—you missed a spot.
Yes, here. Open your eyes.
And about Sherry
and Tom—I’d never tell them
what I said, of course.
It’s all hypothetical, dear.
When does love enter
the picture?
Don’t get so sentimental.
It always finds
a way, dear,
it always does.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>toes</title><link>/poems/23-10-26-toes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/23-10-26-toes/</guid><description>&lt;p>A table
a look
a touch.
A fable
a laugh
a brush.
Temptation
hesitation
your toes

Tongues

We vow
to pray

did you see that?
It&amp;rsquo;s so
beautiful!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>And&lt;/em>
&lt;em>what about this?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes it&amp;rsquo;s so,
well I can&amp;rsquo;t find
the words for it
but yes
it&amp;rsquo;s so
beautiful!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Wait a little&lt;/em>
&lt;em>longer.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What do you mean?
It&amp;rsquo;s so beautiful!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>We might discover&lt;/em>
&lt;em>something more&lt;/em>
&lt;em>if we hold&lt;/em>
&lt;em>our tongues.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mmm,
like this?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Yes,&lt;/em>
&lt;em>like this.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fly in a café</title><link>/poems/23-10-13-fly/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/23-10-13-fly/</guid><description>&lt;p>Curious fly
with your
thousand
eyes,
what is it
that you see
in me?   Today
I am     your flower
and you are        my bee
because   it seems
you can’t get
enough   of me.
Have I forgotten
to wash
this     and that
patch     of skin?
Or were     you meant
to   light
the night	within?
I want     to crush you
with my hand.
I want       to map you
with my       words
and hopeless plans.
You are Plato’s     Ideal
that which cannot
be   touched.
Perhaps       then
between you
and     me
this
is enough.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Questions for the man</title><link>/poems/23-10-12-questions-man/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/23-10-12-questions-man/</guid><description>&lt;p>How&amp;rsquo;s a man supposed to feel when
he lives for nothing more than ends?
His circumstances pull him one way
yet something else demands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Is he honoring the call?
Is he ready to let go and fall
so that he can be caught
by forces he&amp;rsquo;s long forgot?
To really feel in his bones
that he was never in fact alone?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He&amp;rsquo;s got money, he&amp;rsquo;s got time, so why
does he yearn for the sublime?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And when did it become so important
to be right?
When did his life turn into
a series of fights&lt;/p>
&lt;p>against the man in the mirror?
How did fear
replace love?
When did the glove
become life itself?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Is it possible to change
while keeping everything
the same? To hold what
is no longer his
without setting himself
aflame?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Does he need his light
to dwell in the dark?
Can he put out the flame
and follow his heart?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>5AM</title><link>/poems/23-08-30-fiveam/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/23-08-30-fiveam/</guid><description>&lt;p>I woke up at 5am to make my roommate breakfast because it’s her first day of school as a teacher. Afterwards I couldn’t fall back asleep and began instead to listen to the early morning. It’s a pleasant if not unerring space to be in. It’s just you and the slowness of the hour, held by an awareness of the moment, steeping in the water of creation, wherein the mind remains quiet and ripe. Here nothing is asked of you except, perhaps, to listen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sound of a cricket and the no-sound
of absence. No sense not nonsense,
only the hushed humming of morning.
Morning, still with dust in its eyes,
darkness, wrapping up its shift.
The birds have begun to rehearse
while the dead mourn their last drink.
Thoughts piercing the veil of dreams,
shadows creeping over the landscape.
The movement of water
through pipes and the air unseen.
My existence made known
in the quiet clattering of keys.
Streams of consciousness
louder than the Winooski river.
A lonely crow echoing
in the distance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A poem for Québec</title><link>/poems/23-08-21-quebec/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/23-08-21-quebec/</guid><description>&lt;p>In stillness Québec flowers.
Like the first shot of espresso
or your last kiss of the morning
and perhaps even after
a perfectly placed line-break,
its flavor rolls and multiples,
grows and expands
the way words and sentences
do over full-stops and commas,
the longer you linger.
So linger a little longer.
Come to the realization
that tourists and citizens
are all the same
when they meet your gaze
at the windowpane.
Listen to how the children speak
in footsteps and foreign tongues
and still find each other.
Notice how even grief
is content to waif and flâneur
along the cobble-covered streets.
Later, when you&amp;rsquo;re meeting someone
for the first time and their hands
are already all over you,
convincing you that
&lt;em>You are a silly American&lt;/em>
&lt;em>and this is how we will bridge&lt;/em>
&lt;em>the distance of language,&lt;/em>
you are ready to surrender.
Later, when you&amp;rsquo;re mouthing
your goodbyes at the bus stop,
you are ready to depart.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Running</title><link>/poems/23-08-05-running/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/23-08-05-running/</guid><description>&lt;p>They asked for his time,
not how he got here.
Let me wonder then:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Did he stumble?
Did his body crumble
at all like
a soggy crepe
held up by sticks
on his way
to some
pre-determined
somewhere?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or did he bumble
like a bee, all grace
&amp;amp; no trace of
a single step,
every toe kissing
the asphalt
as if it were
dirt?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The numbers reveal
one thing while hiding
everything else.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lessons from RRR</title><link>/poems/04-10-23-rrr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/04-10-23-rrr/</guid><description>&lt;p>Sometimes a rhyme is good.
Avoid all shrouds and sometimes
repetition too. Subtract words
as needed, maybe all of them.
Keep one ear close to the page
and listen&lt;/p>
&lt;p>to the heartbeat&lt;/p>
&lt;p>of every word, every space,
every line; see how lines
define
and break
and keep steady the pace
of a poem. And remember that
heart is at the center of it all.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Birds</title><link>/poems/04-06-23-birds/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/04-06-23-birds/</guid><description>&lt;p>One moment I’m a philosopher, all words
and fat with truth. The next I’m a poet
moonlighting for something new to say.
I’ve tried on the certainty of equations
since they promised me the last word.
But I liked the birds instead, every word
of theirs a spell that guarantees
the truth of my existence,
that truths are truisms
only sometimes true,
that Truth itself lies
within and beyond
what can be said
and has been said
with words.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Oranges</title><link>/poems/04-04-23-oranges/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/04-04-23-oranges/</guid><description>&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s real

the whole

walls despite how many times I squished you
nudged you onto paper mail to leave you
out in the harsh winter air, where confused
you wondered what happened to the warmth of
a home that once housed your black-red body.
You looked at me with curiosity
the other day as I was about to
sweep you away. You crawled along the top
of my couch, and when I approached you turned
your body, antennae, and zigzagged legs
at me as if you knew what was coming.
In a funny way you give my days shape
consistency in my daily motions
meaning I am not creative in how
I get rid of you from my empty flat
always with guilt and a pinch of remorse
because you are there during lonely nights
in the vents, hiding in the windowsill,
always available like morning light
to spring me from my longing, to wake me
into something just beyond the outline
of my well-known interiorities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spider</title><link>/poems/11-12-22-spider/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/11-12-22-spider/</guid><description>&lt;p>Twiggy spider
on my yoga mat
thank you for undoing
the past hour
of self folding
and holding with your
unannounced appearance.
I know
you&amp;rsquo;ve been watching
and have suggestions
for how
I carry my body.
After all I have
a thousand times
the neurons and only
a fraction
of your intention
and grace.
You walk on eight
stilettos and still
men like me
chase beauty
and women
and forget
you exist.
But we get each other.
We&amp;rsquo;re foreign
to ourselves
but not strangers.
We give
birth
and die.
And in
the in-between
we weave
and cradle
worlds
with our extremities.
We might even
for a second
acknowledge
the other
in passing:
I a moving
mountain,
You a pebble
who has seen
it all
from your
small corner
of the world.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Crevasses</title><link>/poems/11-10-22-crevasses/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/11-10-22-crevasses/</guid><description>&lt;p>How beautiful it is
that landlocked bodies
of water will find
their way to the ocean
through crevasses
no one else can see.
That something as light
as wind can carry
the heaviness of traveled waves
for miles through miles
of emptiness and longing
to distant shorelines
where at last they may find
a witness to their journey.
&lt;em>Rest and stay awhile&lt;/em>, he says,
&lt;em>the sand is warm, the sun a friend.&lt;/em>
&lt;em>Tell me the story of how you found&lt;/em>
&lt;em>your way through the cracks. Show me&lt;/em>
&lt;em>how you pieced yourself together&lt;/em>
&lt;em>and dared the great escape.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Live the questions</title><link>/poems/10-03-22-questions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/10-03-22-questions/</guid><description>&lt;p>There goes the body again
trying to find answers
where only questions exist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where do we go from here?
Why does hope feel so heavy?
Who am I without love and direction?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rilke said to live
the questions, as if
by following the curves&lt;/p>
&lt;p>of their bodies
you would be led
to the full-stop of your life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course,
everyone has their answers
and I am still here&lt;/p>
&lt;p>writing of curves and bodies.
Such is life they say.

with strangers who feel
like home, every one of us
a vessel for croissants
and coffee we don&amp;rsquo;t taste.
We sunbathe and drink
behind windows
and wonder why
we&amp;rsquo;re still so pale.
Meanwhile the sun
continues to give
life to the land
and anyone who sees
that the exit
is the entrance,
that coffee
was meant to be enjoyed
in colder hands.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Neighbor El</title><link>/poems/09-23-22-neighbor-el/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/09-23-22-neighbor-el/</guid><description>&lt;p>On the day you fell
the life you lived
and the future you wanted
came down from the clouds
to taste the cold hard Earth.
The strong column of bone
that carried your adventurous spirit
was crushed,
not by the fishing boats
you once sailed in the West,
not by the numerous hours
you spent hunched over
planning and printing photos
in the dark for acclaimed
men of New York City,
but by mere coincidence,
a misplaced foot perhaps
in a life that couldn’t keep up with you.
Still, that didn’t stop you
from peeking over the fence
and startling me with your big glasses
and bigger hello one early morning.
You bent over and snapped me
some sprigs of lavender
from your lovely garden.
A housewarming gift you said
for the new kid on the block.
Then there were the eggs
I wanted but couldn’t eat,
freshly laid by your dearly loved hens.
Their happiness became a familiar sound
in the quiet dawn that housed our street.
I heard yours too in the way
you talked and tended to them
as if they were sacred royalty.
“They only eat organic.”
You talked to the wildflowers too.
You always asked them
to come home with you
(if they wanted to)
and they responded every time
with glee. They knew
what care and joy felt like.
Rising from my own fall,
after all these years,
now I know it too.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Old Haunts</title><link>/poems/09-20-22-haunts/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/09-20-22-haunts/</guid><description>&lt;p>There is always the trace of you
in these places we once called ours.
I&amp;rsquo;m here again today and
now they&amp;rsquo;re only mine and yours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I come from time to time
just to see if things have changed.
Not much has
though there&amp;rsquo;s a new couch now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And there is still
that familiar knot
in the butter of this biscuit
as savory as our kisses were.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My coffee is still dark
like the blades of your eyes,
your rooibos tea now
a touch lighter than mine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m here to find
what only I can see.
What you always saw,
what I simply perceived.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m stronger this time
but I still bend like your smile.
The new couch is staring at me
and I&amp;rsquo;m wondering what is right.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>With grace</title><link>/poems/08-29-22-grace/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/08-29-22-grace/</guid><description>&lt;p>count the possibilities
on your toes this time,
as if they were suddenly
released from the grip
of boots too small
for feet meant to kiss the earth.
Walk until your feet need rest
and rest. Worry for awhile
and let the sand remind you
of rocks and change. Then
go and find yourself
on the other side of the shore
where love always fits
in places it once couldn’t.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>hunger</title><link>/poems/08-28-22-hunger/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/08-28-22-hunger/</guid><description>&lt;p>You’re a painting

a smile just for show –&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Does the hunger ever end?
even in romance and pretense
even in more-than-just–friends –&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You’re poetry
You’re heaved sonnets to a delicate love song–
An Oliver and a Dickinson&lt;/p>
&lt;p>in a world that wants
Cummings
and Nerudas –&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You are freedom
You are madness kissed
You are fires to a spark –&lt;/p>

to have have fun. Rerun
every kiss you ever held

&lt;p>Watch the sun paint the sky
in thankless strokes. Let your mind
play roulette with all your hopes.
Tell yourself you have to do this
alone. Remind yourself
you&amp;rsquo;ll never find yourself
and your way back home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t confess what a mess
you are. Count your sins
and every scar. Convince
yourself you still want

of loss and shadows, how both

You always had to be
two steps ahead Dad said
if you wanted to survive.
Stories that were never mine

the past I inherited, the rest
a future that had no use for dreams

was no longer a roof

for something more than history.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Petty</title><link>/poems/08-12-22-petty/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/08-12-22-petty/</guid><description>&lt;p>You didn’t text me on my birthday.
I know I know, I walked away
but you asked if you could
even when everything was breaking
between us in that burning room and now
I’m breaking and thought you would
save me, like you always did. But still,
perhaps, you knew, like you always did,
what my heart needed most, and gave that
to me instead. You, the better put-together half,
are still saving me, even after all this time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Things I'm Not Telling Myself</title><link>/poems/08-11-22-things-im-not/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/08-11-22-things-im-not/</guid><description>&lt;p>You miss her. You want to tell her you miss her.
You want to say you feel lost and alone,
that you feel like you&amp;rsquo;re the world&amp;rsquo;s biggest dunce
every morning when you wake up empty-handed
and every empty-handed minute before nightfall.
But she is not what you need right now.
You need to confront, with compassion,
whatever it is that led you here.
You need to let go of the dreams and fantasies
and to root yourself in reality. You need to be
and to become the one you need.
It’s difficult to let go
of what you loved, so be patient&lt;/p>
&lt;p>with yourself. Trust yourself. Let yourself
be carried in the arms of others
as you pick up the tender pieces
of your hardened heart. Sadness and grief
are a part of the healing. You can
and will change for next time.
There will be a next time, another chance,
another love. It&amp;rsquo;s hard, but you&amp;rsquo;re intimate
with stubbornness and tenacity. You know pain
and heartbreak. Continue and put words on the page
through your misty eyes and aching knees.
Give oxygen to a soul that is hungry for warmth
and fire. Let the tears fall&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but don&amp;rsquo;t let them put out the flame.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Oatmeal</title><link>/poems/07-24-22-oatmeal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/07-24-22-oatmeal/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m eating my last bowl of oatmeal,
looking outside the window
of a life that was meant for us.
It’s perfectly framed:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You in the sunlit kitchen
singing dad rock making ciabatta,
swaying your small hips to rhythms
still foreign to me&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and I endlessly pondering
how to fit
all of it
onto evenly spaced lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Love was delicious to you.
The tomatoes you grew
welcomed eating and everything
else that needed to be tasted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was there to catch them
with my clumsy hands when
they at last fell, bringing you down
with me to kiss the generous earth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I’m waiting and twisting
my cold spoon in circles
until one day I hunger
for something more than oats.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chaos</title><link>/poems/07-03-22-chaos/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/07-03-22-chaos/</guid><description>&lt;p>I hold the world

have done to your hands.
The hands of a man
born on two shorelines,
the hands of an artist
and engineer who makes knives
pirouette on stained bamboo boards.
You still season the chicken
with ginger and sarcasm,
and your pho reminds us
that all love needs
is bones and water.
I&amp;rsquo;ve tried writing the steps
down, but what recipe
could ever contain you?
Who could hope to recreate
what you have touched?
God has made his attempts,
but the angel you once held
wants nothing more
than your hands again.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dad</title><link>/poems/papa/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/papa/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hunched over in your garden

with your thankless devotion,
praying one day that
we will eventually grow
back in your direction.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Waiting</title><link>/poems/waiting/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/waiting/</guid><description>&lt;p>The news came over you

So claim what you see.
In your crosshair my heart

To everything you know.
But don’t worry I’ll dance
With you real slow.
What’s the rush you’re in
Such a hurry.
My questions lack answers
But it’s a lifelong journey.
Shoot if you have to
And say it was for love.
What you would die for
Is a taste of this blood.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ingredients</title><link>/poems/ingredients/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/ingredients/</guid><description>&lt;p>One pinch of fun, just enough for two.

Nine gallons of luck, Papa said,

Ten drops of honey, to top things off.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Forgive Me Szymborska</title><link>/poems/possibilities/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/possibilities/</guid><description>&lt;p>I prefer chocolate.

For now release. Sink in. Breathe again.
Feel the cold beneath your feet.
Feel the hug of the rising sun.
Notice how something as thin as grass
can hold the weight of the world.
Notice how something as light as air
can carry the dramas of civilization.
Watch your thoughts come and go like clouds.
Let time slow down. Let space be space.
And breathe again.
Listen to the silence.
Listen to the sound of your beating heart.
Hear the rhythms of existence ebb and flow

Open your eyes when you&amp;rsquo;re ready

crawling toward the sun.
You weaved through the leaves
and fought against the voice of Mother,
and finally, finally,
you reached the peak.

singing without the need for recognition,
you opened the crimson shell

when fear runs deep.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lovers</title><link>/poems/lovers-trees/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/lovers-trees/</guid><description>&lt;p>Winter stripped you of your Colors
and left you standing – Naked –
without so much as a kiss&lt;/p>
&lt;p>while the two lovers climbed your branches
and celebrated together
all that they would miss.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They declared their Love
with their crooked names
on your soft bark–&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;For you,&amp;rdquo; they whispered,
as you smiled above, no longer lonely
in the afternoon dark.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Refuge</title><link>/poems/refuge/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/refuge/</guid><description>&lt;p>Find refuge in my Harbor
the water Here is clear,
The Storm is over now
Rest easy now, my Dear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let your Anchor reach
the depths of my Sea,
Let it Sink with Time
while you set yourself Free.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Strip the worn Sails
and cast them to new Hands,
Let them taste again
the Salt of warm Sands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turn the Whites into Doves
that soar the open sky,
Turn the Kites into Loves
who Fly you through Night.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>To the Sky</title><link>/poems/to-sky/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/to-sky/</guid><description>&lt;p>There I threw my sorrows
in hopes that they would stay.
Instead you returned tomorrow
with the weight of yesterday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Forgive me for asking twice,
I&amp;rsquo;ve already begged in prayer–
He returned a palm full of ice,
a reminder that life isn&amp;rsquo;t fair.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The crows made their sighs
and the sunflowers bowed,
I screamed shouted and cried
while you stood indifferent and proud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The grass gleamed with dew
as I endured the cold pain,
while the earth smiled, renewed,
and thanked me for the rain.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blue</title><link>/poems/blue/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/blue/</guid><description>&lt;p>I walked to the lake

our sky sketched from creation,
our soul canvas colored by
dancing constellations.
A place open to all
(if you&amp;rsquo;re not
afraid of heights)
A home for two who
craft dreams
by candlelight.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Our Room</title><link>/poems/our-room/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/our-room/</guid><description>&lt;p>Pens and paintbrushes
scattered on the bathroom floor.
Half-finished poems
and crooked photos
line the chipping walls.
In the dark corners our two desks rest.
The candles are beyond extinguished,
our eyesight isn&amp;rsquo;t the best.
Loved ones tell us they&amp;rsquo;re concerned,
they say we need something different,
but we can still see
that we already have
All we can dream of
and more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Knowledge</title><link>/poems/knowledge/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/knowledge/</guid><description>&lt;p>She sits in her lab
with a handful of instruments
and a head full of clues.
Surrounding her are guesses,
and things she already knew.
If only she could see it,
if only she could understand
how it all fits together
in the grand master plan.
The past always resolves the future,
so she&amp;rsquo;s learned,
in the present of her time,
but still, she feels,
There is so much left to find,
there is still so much to know.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Improvise</title><link>/poems/improvise/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/improvise/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am a living shadow of the life I dream–
The Golden days are so far it seems–
One step forward and two skips back–
Time is ticking away–tick–tick–clack–
I’m supposed to have This figured out–
But still I don’t know what this Play is all About?–
Read the script now the Mind pouts–
No–write more Reason shouts–
The curtain will soon fall–
Already on stage–it&amp;rsquo;s last call!–
Hide your face and be disguised–
Show the emotions we improvised–
Outside–applause in the dark unseen–
Inside–thoughts clouding the movie screen–&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Again</title><link>/poems/again/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/again/</guid><description>&lt;p>God’s knocking at the bedroom door
again. You redress yourself in reason
but the devilish grin isn’t coming off
as easily as before.
You tell me we’re pushing it,
you say we asked for forgiveness
last time. But I remind you
that he’s a professional,
that we keep him in business
by asking over and over
and over again.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Love</title><link>/poems/love/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/love/</guid><description>&lt;p>Love is a distance
that wants to be closed
like a door by those
who forget it breathes
in the space between
what was forgotten
and the suddenly
remembered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I forgot. And then
I remembered.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dwell</title><link>/poems/dwell/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/dwell/</guid><description>&lt;p>What rooms of the soul
have we left unchecked
Forgotten and locked away
With the key nowhere to be found?
Don&amp;rsquo;t worry.
The door is still open.
Climb the creaking stairs
Open the dust-covered drawers and look in
Run your fingers along the wooden shelves
now draped in darkness,
somewhere in the attic of your mind.
Once there you may rediscover
the very thing
You have been searching for
Your entire life.
Prepare yourself:
The ghosts will cry and beckon.
But don&amp;rsquo;t run.
Sit and stay awhile.
Get to know yourself.
Offer light
and accept the forgiveness
that soon follows.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exhalation</title><link>/poems/exhalation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/exhalation/</guid><description>&lt;p>Before there was you
Before there was you and your billowing laugh
Your callused hands and crooked smile
waiting for me at the end of the night
like temptation drunk on cherry wine&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before there was the oak that introduced us
Before there were the stars we claimed as ours
Before love and wonder were forces we would never tame
Before time had entered the fray
Before there was the story of everything, waiting to unfold,
Nothing was the only thing
And that was enough for a universe.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Trapeze</title><link>/poems/trapeze/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/trapeze/</guid><description>&lt;p>The only way this works
is if we catch each other.
We’re experienced, yes, but the connection
is never guaranteed, even after all these years.
The nets below don’t carry
the weight of our selfish love,
nor does the crowd.
They wonder how we do what we do,
why we take the risks we take,
but we’re just doing our job,
putting on a performance
for an audience of one.
Sometimes we fall
but that’s a part of the deal –
We’re acrobats of the dark she said,
two loose cannons
shooting for the stars,
two trapeze artists vaulting
over loneliness,
two unhinged orbits
ready to collide.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enough</title><link>/poems/enough/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/enough/</guid><description>&lt;p>Cowbells in the distance
Dissonance afar.
Possibility and yearning
Under a sky full of stars.
Somewhere the mountains call
For a fleet-footed boy
To cross them all.
Another day, he said, with bright reassurance
But little did he know
There would be no other occurrence.
Later is a long time to wait
and life took its swing
Along with life he went and gone were his dreams.
Kept hidden and out of sight
He lost them all in a single night.
They returned to the stars above
Waiting for another day
For someone new to look up and say
This is enough.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Seagulls</title><link>/poems/seagulls/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/seagulls/</guid><description>&lt;p>Two birds in unison along a grayed shore walking
and squawking like inseparable twins&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Talking and squealing in that terrifying tongue
only they can understand,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mocking our efforts to tame the unknown, laughing
because we can’t in the face of uncertainty.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But for all our differences, I was reassured to find
that they shit&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In much the same way
we do.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Winter</title><link>/poems/winter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/winter/</guid><description>&lt;p>A season between seasons
a bridge crossed by the plentiful few,
Adults seek it endlessly
though already the children knew.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don’t bother with asking ––
we’re sworn to secrecy.
I myself have nothing to say
though clues are not certainties:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Between one breath of Winter
and one sigh of Spring,
go to where the avians
dare to fly and sing.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
