        <p>On the day you fell
the life you lived
and the future you wanted
came down from the clouds
to taste the cold hard Earth.
The strong column of bone
that carried your adventurous spirit
was crushed,
not by the fishing boats
you once sailed in the West,
not by the numerous hours
you spent hunched over
planning and printing photos
in the dark for acclaimed
men of New York City,
but by mere coincidence,
a misplaced foot perhaps
in a life that couldn’t keep up with you.
Still, that didn’t stop you
from peeking over the fence
and startling me with your big glasses
and bigger hello one early morning.
You bent over and snapped me
some sprigs of lavender
from your lovely garden.
A housewarming gift you said
for the new kid on the block.
Then there were the eggs
I wanted but couldn’t eat,
freshly laid by your dearly loved hens.
Their happiness became a familiar sound
in the quiet dawn that housed our street.
I heard yours too in the way
you talked and tended to them
as if they were sacred royalty.
“They only eat organic.”
You talked to the wildflowers too.
You always asked them
to come home with you
(if they wanted to)
and they responded every time
with glee. They knew
what care and joy felt like.
Rising from my own fall,
after all these years,
now I know it too.</p>
