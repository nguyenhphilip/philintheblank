<p>You didn’t text me on my birthday.
I know I know, I walked away
but you asked if you could
even when everything was breaking
between us in that burning room and now
I’m breaking and thought you would
save me, like you always did. But still,
perhaps, you knew, like you always did,
what my heart needed most, and gave that
to me instead. You, the better put-together half,
are still saving me, even after all this time.</p>

<p>You miss her. You want to tell her you miss her.
You want to say you feel lost and alone,
that you feel like you&rsquo;re the world&rsquo;s biggest dunce
every morning when you wake up empty-handed
and every empty-handed minute before nightfall.
But she is not what you need right now.
You need to confront, with compassion,
whatever it is that led you here.
You need to let go of the dreams and fantasies
and to root yourself in reality. You need to be
and to become the one you need.
It’s difficult to let go
of what you loved, so be patient</p>

<p>I’m eating my last bowl of oatmeal,
looking outside the window
of a life that was meant for us.
It’s perfectly framed:</p>
<p>You in the sunlit kitchen
singing dad rock making ciabatta,
swaying your small hips to rhythms
still foreign to me</p>
<p>and I endlessly pondering
how to fit
all of it
onto evenly spaced lines.</p>
<p>Love was delicious to you.
The tomatoes you grew
welcomed eating and everything
else that needed to be tasted.</p>

<p>I hold the world
In a single equation.</p>
<p><em>Don’t forget to express the bifurcations.</em></p>
<p>A flap in the wind
A sudden change of heart
I have accounted for
every unknown start.</p>
<p><em>But what of love and culture</em>
<em>And romance too?</em></p>
<p>It is all certain
In the limit of time.</p>
<p><em>But until then</em>
<em>what do you believe</em></p>
<p><em>that we will do?</em></p>

<p>In the nook of this morning
there is the urge for busyness
and meaning. But the golden
has just hopped between
two humans musing
about the sun. How difficult,
she thinks, to be so thoughtful.
Her neck cranes downward
toward the dirty floorboards
takes a whiff
of what is missing
and suddenly remembers
the shape of dirt.</p>

<p>Look at what all these years
have done to your hands.
The hands of a man
born on two shorelines,
the hands of an artist
and engineer who makes knives
pirouette on stained bamboo boards.
You still season the chicken
with ginger and sarcasm,
and your pho reminds us
that all love needs
is bones and water.
I&rsquo;ve tried writing the steps
down, but what recipe
could ever contain you?
Who could hope to recreate
what you have touched?
God has made his attempts,
but the angel you once held
wants nothing more
than your hands again.</p>

<p>Hunched over in your garden
like a daylily on the boardwalk watching
the world spin faster
and faster on its slant axis,
you still water the plants we bought for you
three summers ago, as if
you were still showering us
with your wordless love,
with your thankless devotion,
praying one day that
we will eventually grow
back in your direction.</p>

<p>The news came over you
the way winter</p>
<p>does, like a wave crawling
up your spine,</p>
<p>every goosebump a sign

<p>you lived by would soon

your heart makes</p>
<p>way for the embers

scars and burn</p>
