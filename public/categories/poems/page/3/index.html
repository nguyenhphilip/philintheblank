<p>Will you start the day now?
Time can only cradle you
for so long, your body so
heavy with duty and obligation.</p>
<p>The questions tugging at your soul
can wait; she will be there
at the end of the day, and if not
perhaps tomorrow – well at least
you have yourself.</p>
<p>And if not that, well,
time will be waiting,
poised like the sliver of a grin,
ready to swing your life away.</p>

<p>I.</p>
<p>In the riptide
    of
    this moment
may I act out of  	goodwill,
may I rediscover
the goodness   of others
    made obfuscate
by timelines     and party lines
    and tighten the loosened thread
that ties us all
  together.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>The gift is knowing
what ails you</p>
<p>the privilege is holding    	that truth
without turning   away–</p>
<p>what I fear most is not that you will hurt me
because in many ways you already have
but that I may never understand	  why</p>

<p>Love is a loaded gun
In certain hands.
Don’t hesitate now
Go make your demands.
My arms are up yes
So claim what you see.
In your crosshair my heart
upon a sleeve.
I confess I’m a threat
To everything you know.
But don’t worry I’ll dance
With you real slow.
What’s the rush you’re in
Such a hurry.
My questions lack answers
But it’s a lifelong journey.
Shoot if you have to
And say it was for love.
What you would die for
Is a taste of this blood.</p>

<p>One pinch of fun, just enough for two.
Two cups of trust – three for the adventurous.
Four cloves of love – more for good measure.
Five pounds of respect to ensure a firm foundation.
Six licks to taste, just in case things turn sour.
Eight hints of promises, so seven can be broken.
Nine gallons of luck, Papa said,
because life always get messy.
Ten drops of honey, to top things off.</p>

<p>I prefer chocolate.
I prefer music.
I prefer facts dancing with feelings.
I prefer Dandelion to Cherry Wine.
I prefer trees dressed in autumn.
I prefer keeping a notebook and pen on hand, just in case.
I prefer the quiet of silence
to the silence of absence.
I prefer the color green.
I prefer rebels.
I prefer not to maintain
that convenience is always convenient.
I prefer to wake early.
I prefer to sleep late when it’s wrong.
I prefer talking to therapists about something else.
I prefer used books.
I prefer the absurdity of kids
to the absurdity of adults.
I prefer, where love’s concerned, nonspecific anniversaries
that can be celebrated every moment.
I prefer friends
who promise me nothing.
I prefer bittersweet compassion to everyday kindness.
I prefer surprises.
I prefer the earth in hand-me-downs.
I prefer bordering countries to bordered ones.
I prefer the hell of questions to the hell of answers.
I prefer cats.
I prefer dogs unleashed.
I prefer the creased line of a Szymborska
to the headline of a newspaper.
I prefer the thrill of knowing to the thrill of believing.
I prefer light eyes, since mine are dark.
I prefer laughter.
I prefer joy to happiness.
I prefer things I’ve forgotten to say
to things I’ve left unsaid.
I prefer the time of seasons to the time of stars.
I prefer to have faith.
I prefer ideas to movements.
I prefer keeping in mind even the possibility
that existence has its own raison d&rsquo;être.</p>

<p>Find a place to rest now. Sit.
Close your eyes – yes, things will be fine.
Breathe. Let go, for a moment,
of worry. Don&rsquo;t worry: he&rsquo;ll be waiting
for you when you open your eyes.
For now release. Sink in. Breathe again.
Feel the cold beneath your feet.
Feel the hug of the rising sun.
Notice how something as thin as grass
can hold the weight of the world.
Notice how something as light as air
can carry the dramas of civilization.
Watch your thoughts come and go like clouds.
Let time slow down. Let space be space.
And breathe again.
Listen to the silence.
Listen to the sound of your beating heart.
Hear the rhythms of existence ebb and flow
erratically between your life and this life.
Open your eyes when you&rsquo;re ready
and let worry in
like an old friend.</p>

<p>You opened up
like a lotus in the night
and allowed me
to feel the shy rhythm
of your untouched
heartbeat
with my callused fingers.
They traced the surface
of your little life
as you guided me
over the eight scars
dotting your body
like flower petals
on the surface
of a boundless lake.</p>

<p><strong><em>I. Summer of COVID-19</em></strong></p>
<p>This time around
the antagonist is a consequence</p>
<p>of randomness
and stupidity;</p>
<p>Not the usual trail of mosquito bites
lining my ankles after a night by the lake–</p>
<p>Not the flakey crust of sunburned shoulders
and sun-spoiled cider roiling in the drunk sand–</p>
<p>Not the hurried kiss of a summer love
meant to be a memory–</p>
<p>No instead I am accompanied by an unfounded certainty,
a future I cannot yet begin to imagine</p>

<p>You asked if I ever
wrote a poem about you
And I said never
Not without another few
Days of this again:</p>
<p>Us by the lake
Unsure
of what to make
of all this time
between us.</p>

<p>older
and still no closer
to heaven. But please,
leave me–</p>
<p>Leave me here where
my prayers are answered
in the rhyme of a Dickinson
or the riff of a Sultana–</p>
<p>Leave me here on the breast
of the earth where angels
kiss sinners like me
over tea and late night memories
on Sunday mornings–</p>
<p>Leave me here where the blessing
of caressing hands is enough
to bend a celibate to his knees
over the pulpit of her body
as they mouth Hallelujah–</p>
