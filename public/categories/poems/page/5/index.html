<p>Find refuge in my Harbor
the water Here is clear,
The Storm is over now
Rest easy now, my Dear.</p>
<p>Let your Anchor reach
the depths of my Sea,
Let it Sink with Time
while you set yourself Free.</p>
<p>Strip the worn Sails
and cast them to new Hands,
Let them taste again
the Salt of warm Sands.</p>
<p>Turn the Whites into Doves
that soar the open sky,
Turn the Kites into Loves
who Fly you through Night.</p>

<p>There I threw my sorrows
in hopes that they would stay.
Instead you returned tomorrow
with the weight of yesterday.</p>
<p>Forgive me for asking twice,
I&rsquo;ve already begged in prayer–
He returned a palm full of ice,
a reminder that life isn&rsquo;t fair.</p>
<p>The crows made their sighs
and the sunflowers bowed,
I screamed shouted and cried
while you stood indifferent and proud.</p>
<p>The grass gleamed with dew
as I endured the cold pain,
while the earth smiled, renewed,
and thanked me for the rain.</p>

<p>I walked to the lake
  to skip
   stones
    the way people do</p>
<p>with their thoughts
  when they at last notice
   that their pockets
    are full.</p>
<p>Then you honked at me
  in your hurried voice
   Good morning - Good morning!
    and invited me to linger</p>
<p>as your webbed feet waltzed
  toe by toe
   across the sand
    into the wild open blue</p>
<p>while loneliness waited
  by the rocks
    and I,
      I drowned in delight.</p>

<p>The rainbow is our dream
our sky sketched from creation,
our soul canvas colored by
dancing constellations.
A place open to all
(if you&rsquo;re not
afraid of heights)
A home for two who
craft dreams
by candlelight.</p>

<p>Pens and paintbrushes
scattered on the bathroom floor.
Half-finished poems
and crooked photos
line the chipping walls.
In the dark corners our two desks rest.
The candles are beyond extinguished,
our eyesight isn&rsquo;t the best.
Loved ones tell us they&rsquo;re concerned,
they say we need something different,
but we can still see
that we already have
All we can dream of
and more.</p>

<p>She sits in her lab
with a handful of instruments
and a head full of clues.
Surrounding her are guesses,
and things she already knew.
If only she could see it,
if only she could understand
how it all fits together
in the grand master plan.
The past always resolves the future,
so she&rsquo;s learned,
in the present of her time,
but still, she feels,
There is so much left to find,
there is still so much to know.</p>

<p>I am a living shadow of the life I dream–
The Golden days are so far it seems–
One step forward and two skips back–
Time is ticking away–tick–tick–clack–
I’m supposed to have This figured out–
But still I don’t know what this Play is all About?–
Read the script now the Mind pouts–
No–write more Reason shouts–
The curtain will soon fall–
Already on stage–it&rsquo;s last call!–
Hide your face and be disguised–
Show the emotions we improvised–
Outside–applause in the dark unseen–
Inside–thoughts clouding the movie screen–</p>

<p>God’s knocking at the bedroom door
again. You redress yourself in reason
but the devilish grin isn’t coming off
as easily as before.
You tell me we’re pushing it,
you say we asked for forgiveness
last time. But I remind you
that he’s a professional,
that we keep him in business
by asking over and over
and over again.</p>

<p>Love is a distance
that wants to be closed
like a door by those
who forget it breathes
in the space between
what was forgotten
and the suddenly
remembered.</p>
<p>I forgot. And then
I remembered.</p>

<p>What rooms of the soul
have we left unchecked
Forgotten and locked away
With the key nowhere to be found?
Don&rsquo;t worry.
The door is still open.
Climb the creaking stairs
Open the dust-covered drawers and look in
Run your fingers along the wooden shelves
now draped in darkness,
somewhere in the attic of your mind.
Once there you may rediscover
the very thing
You have been searching for
Your entire life.
Prepare yourself:
The ghosts will cry and beckon.
But don&rsquo;t run.
Sit and stay awhile.
Get to know yourself.
Offer light
and accept the forgiveness
that soon follows.</p>
