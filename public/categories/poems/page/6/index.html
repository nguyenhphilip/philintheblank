<p>Before there was you
Before there was you and your billowing laugh
Your callused hands and crooked smile
waiting for me at the end of the night
like temptation drunk on cherry wine</p>
<p>Before there was the oak that introduced us
Before there were the stars we claimed as ours
Before love and wonder were forces we would never tame
Before time had entered the fray
Before there was the story of everything, waiting to unfold,
Nothing was the only thing
And that was enough for a universe.</p>

<p>The only way this works
is if we catch each other.
We’re experienced, yes, but the connection
is never guaranteed, even after all these years.
The nets below don’t carry
the weight of our selfish love,
nor does the crowd.
They wonder how we do what we do,
why we take the risks we take,
but we’re just doing our job,
putting on a performance
for an audience of one.
Sometimes we fall
but that’s a part of the deal –
We’re acrobats of the dark she said,
two loose cannons
shooting for the stars,
two trapeze artists vaulting
over loneliness,
two unhinged orbits
ready to collide.</p>

<p>Cowbells in the distance
Dissonance afar.
Possibility and yearning
Under a sky full of stars.
Somewhere the mountains call
For a fleet-footed boy
To cross them all.
Another day, he said, with bright reassurance
But little did he know
There would be no other occurrence.
Later is a long time to wait
and life took its swing
Along with life he went and gone were his dreams.
Kept hidden and out of sight
He lost them all in a single night.
They returned to the stars above
Waiting for another day
For someone new to look up and say
This is enough.</p>

<p>Two birds in unison along a grayed shore walking
and squawking like inseparable twins</p>
<p>Talking and squealing in that terrifying tongue
only they can understand,</p>
<p>Mocking our efforts to tame the unknown, laughing
because we can’t in the face of uncertainty.</p>
<p>But for all our differences, I was reassured to find
that they shit</p>
<p>In much the same way
we do.</p>

<p>A season between seasons
a bridge crossed by the plentiful few,
Adults seek it endlessly
though already the children knew.</p>
<p>Don’t bother with asking ––
we’re sworn to secrecy.
I myself have nothing to say
though clues are not certainties:</p>
<p>Between one breath of Winter
and one sigh of Spring,
go to where the avians
dare to fly and sing.</p>
