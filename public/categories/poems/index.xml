on my yoga mat
thank you for undoing
the past hour
of self folding
and holding with your
unannounced appearance.
I know
you&amp;rsquo;ve been watching
and have suggestions
for how
I carry my body.
After all I have
a thousand times
the neurons and only
a fraction
of your intention
and grace.
You walk on eight
stilettos and still
men like me
chase beauty
and women
and forget
you exist.
But we get each other.
We&amp;rsquo;re foreign
to ourselves
but not strangers.
We give
birth
and die.
And in
the in-between
we weave
and cradle
worlds
with our extremities.
We might even
for a second
acknowledge
the other
in passing:
I a moving
mountain,
You a pebble
who has seen
it all
from your
small corner
of the world.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Crevasses</title><link>/poems/11-10-22-crevasses/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/11-10-22-crevasses/</guid><description>&lt;p>How beautiful it is
that landlocked bodies
of water will find
their way to the ocean
through crevasses
no one else can see.
That something as light
as wind can carry
the heaviness of traveled waves
for miles through miles
of emptiness and longing
to distant shorelines
where at last they may find
a witness to their journey.
&lt;em>Rest and stay awhile&lt;/em>, he says,
&lt;em>the sand is warm, the sun a friend.&lt;/em>
&lt;em>Tell me the story of how you found&lt;/em>
&lt;em>your way through the cracks. Show me&lt;/em>
&lt;em>how you pieced yourself together&lt;/em>
&lt;em>and dared the great escape.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Live the questions</title><link>/poems/10-03-22-questions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/10-03-22-questions/</guid><description>&lt;p>There goes the body again
trying to find answers
where only questions exist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where do we go from here?
Why does hope feel so heavy?
Who am I without love and direction?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rilke said to live
the questions, as if
by following the curves&lt;/p>
&lt;p>of their bodies
you would be led
to the full-stop of your life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course,
everyone has their answers
and I am still here&lt;/p>
&lt;p>writing of curves and bodies.
Such is life they say.
Did Rilke live his?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My life's work</title><link>/poems/10-03-22-lifes-work/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/10-03-22-lifes-work/</guid><description>&lt;p>is to sit in coffee shops
with strangers who feel
like home, every one of us
a vessel for croissants
and coffee we don&amp;rsquo;t taste.
We sunbathe and drink
behind windows
and wonder why
we&amp;rsquo;re still so pale.
Meanwhile the sun
continues to give
life to the land
and anyone who sees
that the exit
is the entrance,
that coffee
was meant to be enjoyed
in colder hands.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Neighbor El</title><link>/poems/09-23-22-neighbor-el/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/09-23-22-neighbor-el/</guid><description>&lt;p>On the day you fell
the life you lived
and the future you wanted
came down from the clouds
to taste the cold hard Earth.
The strong column of bone
that carried your adventurous spirit
was crushed,
not by the fishing boats
you once sailed in the West,
not by the numerous hours
you spent hunched over
planning and printing photos
in the dark for acclaimed
men of New York City,
but by mere coincidence,
a misplaced foot perhaps
in a life that couldn’t keep up with you.
Still, that didn’t stop you
from peeking over the fence
and startling me with your big glasses
and bigger hello one early morning.
You bent over and snapped me
some sprigs of lavender
from your lovely garden.
A housewarming gift you said
for the new kid on the block.
Then there were the eggs
I wanted but couldn’t eat,
freshly laid by your dearly loved hens.
Their happiness became a familiar sound
in the quiet dawn that housed our street.
I heard yours too in the way
you talked and tended to them
as if they were sacred royalty.
“They only eat organic.”
You talked to the wildflowers too.
You always asked them
to come home with you
(if they wanted to)
and they responded every time
with glee. They knew
what care and joy felt like.
Rising from my own fall,
after all these years,
now I know it too.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Old Haunts</title><link>/poems/09-20-22-haunts/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/09-20-22-haunts/</guid><description>&lt;p>There is always the trace of you
in these places we once called ours.
I&amp;rsquo;m here again today and
now they&amp;rsquo;re only mine and yours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I come from time to time
just to see if things have changed.
Not much has
though there&amp;rsquo;s a new couch now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And there is still
that familiar knot
in the butter of this biscuit
as savory as our kisses were.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My coffee is still dark
like the blades of your eyes,
your rooibos tea now
a touch lighter than mine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m here to find
what only I can see.
What you always saw,
what I simply perceived.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m stronger this time
but I still bend like your smile.
The new couch is staring at me
and I&amp;rsquo;m wondering what is right.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>With grace</title><link>/poems/08-29-22-grace/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/08-29-22-grace/</guid><description>&lt;p>count the possibilities
on your toes this time,
as if they were suddenly
released from the grip
of boots too small
for feet meant to kiss the earth.
Walk until your feet need rest
and rest. Worry for awhile
and let the sand remind you
of rocks and change. Then
go and find yourself
on the other side of the shore
where love always fits
in places it once couldn’t.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>hunger</title><link>/poems/08-28-22-hunger/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/08-28-22-hunger/</guid><description>&lt;p>You’re a painting
You’re a body of photographs
framed in a movie reel –&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You’re music
You’re a guitar that sings
on love-stained strings –&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You’re something to behold
a rose never to touch
a smile just for show –&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Does the hunger ever end?
even in romance and pretense
even in more-than-just–friends –&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You’re poetry
You’re heaved sonnets to a delicate love song–
An Oliver and a Dickinson&lt;/p>
&lt;p>in a world that wants
Cummings
and Nerudas –&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You are freedom
You are madness kissed
You are fires to a spark –&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You are distance
You are desire
You are the reason I walk –&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There I go
yearning
screaming –&lt;/p>
&lt;p>running&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How not to let go</title><link>/poems/08-16-22-let-go-not/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/08-16-22-let-go-not/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hold on. Forget
to have have fun. Rerun
every kiss you ever held
like tomorrow won&amp;rsquo;t come.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Watch the sun paint the sky
in thankless strokes. Let your mind
play roulette with all your hopes.
Tell yourself you have to do this
alone. Remind yourself
you&amp;rsquo;ll never find yourself
and your way back home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t confess what a mess
you are. Count your sins
and every scar. Convince
yourself you still want
what you don&amp;rsquo;t want
and let the Myrtle tree out front
shed her pink dress
without the lonely eyes
of her only witness.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vietnamese-American</title><link>/poems/08-14-22-vietnamese/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/08-14-22-vietnamese/</guid><description>&lt;p>At the age of two I learned
of loss and shadows, how both
can exist without the light.
You always had to be
two steps ahead Dad said
if you wanted to survive.
Stories that were never mine
I carried anyways, one part
the past I inherited, the rest
a future that had no use for dreams
and romance. Home
was no longer a roof
but instead a hunger longing
for something more than history.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Petty</title><link>/poems/08-12-22-petty/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/08-12-22-petty/</guid><description>&lt;p>You didn’t text me on my birthday.
I know I know, I walked away
but you asked if you could
even when everything was breaking
between us in that burning room and now
I’m breaking and thought you would
save me, like you always did. But still,
perhaps, you knew, like you always did,
what my heart needed most, and gave that
to me instead. You, the better put-together half,
are still saving me, even after all this time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Things I'm Not Telling Myself</title><link>/poems/08-11-22-things-im-not/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/08-11-22-things-im-not/</guid><description>&lt;p>You miss her. You want to tell her you miss her.
You want to say you feel lost and alone,
that you feel like you&amp;rsquo;re the world&amp;rsquo;s biggest dunce
every morning when you wake up empty-handed
and every empty-handed minute before nightfall.
But she is not what you need right now.
You need to confront, with compassion,
whatever it is that led you here.
You need to let go of the dreams and fantasies
and to root yourself in reality. You need to be
and to become the one you need.
It’s difficult to let go
of what you loved, so be patient&lt;/p>
&lt;p>with yourself. Trust yourself. Let yourself
be carried in the arms of others
as you pick up the tender pieces
of your hardened heart. Sadness and grief
are a part of the healing. You can
and will change for next time.
There will be a next time, another chance,
another love. It&amp;rsquo;s hard, but you&amp;rsquo;re intimate
with stubbornness and tenacity. You know pain
and heartbreak. Continue and put words on the page
through your misty eyes and aching knees.
Give oxygen to a soul that is hungry for warmth
and fire. Let the tears fall&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but don&amp;rsquo;t let them put out the flame.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Oatmeal</title><link>/poems/07-24-22-oatmeal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/07-24-22-oatmeal/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m eating my last bowl of oatmeal,
looking outside the window
of a life that was meant for us.
It’s perfectly framed:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You in the sunlit kitchen
singing dad rock making ciabatta,
swaying your small hips to rhythms
still foreign to me&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and I endlessly pondering
how to fit
all of it
onto evenly spaced lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Love was delicious to you.
The tomatoes you grew
welcomed eating and everything
else that needed to be tasted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was there to catch them
with my clumsy hands when
they at last fell, bringing you down
with me to kiss the generous earth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I’m waiting and twisting
my cold spoon in circles
until one day I hunger
for something more than oats.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chaos</title><link>/poems/07-03-22-chaos/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/07-03-22-chaos/</guid><description>&lt;p>I hold the world
In a single equation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Don’t forget to express the bifurcations.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A flap in the wind
A sudden change of heart
I have accounted for
every unknown start.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>But what of love and culture&lt;/em>
&lt;em>And romance too?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is all certain
In the limit of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>But until then&lt;/em>
&lt;em>what do you believe&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>that we will do?&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Morning</title><link>/poems/morning/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/morning/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the nook of this morning
there is the urge for busyness
and meaning. But the golden
has just hopped between
two humans musing
about the sun. How difficult,
she thinks, to be so thoughtful.
Her neck cranes downward
toward the dirty floorboards
takes a whiff
of what is missing
and suddenly remembers
the shape of dirt.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hands</title><link>/poems/hands/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/hands/</guid><description>&lt;p>Look at what all these years
have done to your hands.
The hands of a man
born on two shorelines,
the hands of an artist
and engineer who makes knives
pirouette on stained bamboo boards.
You still season the chicken
with ginger and sarcasm,
and your pho reminds us
that all love needs
is bones and water.
I&amp;rsquo;ve tried writing the steps
down, but what recipe
could ever contain you?
Who could hope to recreate
what you have touched?
God has made his attempts,
but the angel you once held
wants nothing more
than your hands again.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dad</title><link>/poems/papa/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/papa/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hunched over in your garden
like a daylily on the boardwalk watching
the world spin faster
and faster on its slant axis,
you still water the plants we bought for you
three summers ago, as if
you were still showering us
with your wordless love,
with your thankless devotion,
praying one day that
we will eventually grow
back in your direction.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Waiting</title><link>/poems/waiting/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/waiting/</guid><description>&lt;p>The news came over you
the way winter&lt;/p>
&lt;p>does, like a wave crawling
up your spine,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>every goosebump a sign
that the story&lt;/p>
&lt;p>you lived by would soon
come to its&lt;/p>
&lt;p>end. The fire warming
your heart makes&lt;/p>
&lt;p>way for the embers
and ashes,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>for all that’s left, black
scars and burn&lt;/p>
&lt;p>marks, a house without
a roof, memories&lt;/p>
&lt;p>forever frozen
in place. You’ll&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Know he’s gone when

by the measure of things&lt;/p>
&lt;p>though memory and circumstance

&lt;p>they only see
the distance&lt;/p>
&lt;p>between who we were then

&lt;p>i can’t tell if you’re smiling
or if that’s the wrinkle&lt;/p>
&lt;p>in your eye
reminding me&lt;/p>
&lt;p>of where we’ve been
and where we’re still going.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>there’s not much
of that for us anymore,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>we’ve had our fair share

&lt;p>but you’re still surprised

My arms are up yes
So claim what you see.
In your crosshair my heart

To everything you know.
But don’t worry I’ll dance
With you real slow.
What’s the rush you’re in
Such a hurry.
My questions lack answers
But it’s a lifelong journey.
Shoot if you have to
And say it was for love.

Nine gallons of luck, Papa said,

Ten drops of honey, to top things off.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Forgive Me Szymborska</title><link>/poems/possibilities/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/possibilities/</guid><description>&lt;p>I prefer chocolate.

Close your eyes – yes, things will be fine.
Breathe. Let go, for a moment,
of worry. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry: he&amp;rsquo;ll be waiting

For now release. Sink in. Breathe again.
Feel the cold beneath your feet.
Feel the hug of the rising sun.
Notice how something as thin as grass
can hold the weight of the world.
Notice how something as light as air
can carry the dramas of civilization.
Watch your thoughts come and go like clouds.
Let time slow down. Let space be space.
And breathe again.
Listen to the silence.
Listen to the sound of your beating heart.
Hear the rhythms of existence ebb and flow
erratically between your life and this life.
Open your eyes when you&amp;rsquo;re ready
and let worry in
like an old friend.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vulnerability</title><link>/poems/vulnerability/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/vulnerability/</guid><description>&lt;p>You opened up

&lt;p>Oscillating between&lt;/p>
&lt;p>despair and

&lt;p>newsfeeds

&lt;p>poems and

&lt;p>pasts and
a reality&lt;/p>
&lt;p>running from reach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;em>III. Falling&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your face in the bathroom mirror
again staring back at someone
something unknowable
wondering how long
it takes for regret
to leave
the
body&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;em>IV. How&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To move forward?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get over myself?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To save myself&lt;/p>
&lt;p>when I myself&lt;/p>
&lt;p>lack myself&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the smiling&lt;/p>
&lt;p>confidence&lt;/p>
&lt;p>of an untouched life?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;em>V. Kintsugi&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Begin with love
and generous fingertips,
yours. Lace the roiled sand
between the cracks
and piece together
the moments
one by one.
Hold them still
as if your life
depended on
it–it does–
and wait.
Growth requires
time. Meaning
demands patience.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Meeting Again</title><link>/poems/for-a-friend/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/for-a-friend/</guid><description>&lt;p>You asked if I ever

more

Memories of forgotten days counting stars–

I’m drifting on
a rusty boat
in open sea
heading nowhere
and everywhere
like birch seeds floating
on the warm breath
of a Vermont summer,
searching for a place
to land and settle,
an identity to inhabit
and call my own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a story I can’t get over, mine,
this collection of half-finished poems
full of half-hearted lines
that sketch the color of my thoughts.
Answers are supposed to help
but the questions
are quicker to rise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still, beneath the sail
lies the redeeming oar.
Grab it and propel yourself forward
into the winds of opportunity,
and when the storm inevitably comes
as it always does
ride the waves
and soar above
the tempests that seek
to cloud the light
bursting from your heart.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lady in Red</title><link>/poems/lady_red/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/lady_red/</guid><description>&lt;p>While the yellow-jackets mingle with
the Azaleas and the sunflowers
and the people with only each other,
You were there in the sky
on a young branch navigating
the heights of which
far too few have seen,
crawling toward the sun.
You weaved through the leaves
and fought against the voice of Mother,
and finally, finally,
you reached the peak.
Then, just like the robins,
just like the timid sparrows
singing without the need for recognition,
you opened the crimson shell
housing your weightless wings
and flew to the only place you knew
was home.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Remembering</title><link>/poems/remembering/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/remembering/</guid><description>&lt;p>A Black birder

&lt;p>A Black man
his body pinned

haven&amp;rsquo;t you had enough?
Just grant me this once
a wish from above.
I&amp;rsquo;m asking for reassurance, perhaps,

just leave me flowers at my door

Why can&amp;rsquo;t you just Settle?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My restless mind looks through
the windowsill and begs
for the world outside–
Go, now, it whispers,
there is nothing here

&lt;p>Be bold. Be brave.
Put on a straight face
and take the leap –
what opportunities missed

scattered on the bathroom floor.
Half-finished poems
and crooked photos
line the chipping walls.
In the dark corners our two desks rest.
The candles are beyond extinguished,
our eyesight isn&amp;rsquo;t the best.
Loved ones tell us they&amp;rsquo;re concerned,
they say we need something different,
but we can still see
that we already have
All we can dream of

with a handful of instruments

Surrounding her are guesses,

If only she could see it,
if only she could understand
how it all fits together

The past always resolves the future,
so she&amp;rsquo;s learned,
in the present of her time,
but still, she feels,
There is so much left to find,
there is still so much to know.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Improvise</title><link>/poems/improvise/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/improvise/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am a living shadow of the life I dream–

Read the script now the Mind pouts–
No–write more Reason shouts–
The curtain will soon fall–
Already on stage–it&amp;rsquo;s last call!–

Show the emotions we improvised–
Outside–applause in the dark unseen–
Inside–thoughts clouding the movie screen–&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Again</title><link>/poems/again/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/again/</guid><description>&lt;p>God’s knocking at the bedroom door

Forgotten and locked away
With the key nowhere to be found?
Don&amp;rsquo;t worry.
The door is still open.
Climb the creaking stairs
Open the dust-covered drawers and look in
Run your fingers along the wooden shelves
now draped in darkness,
somewhere in the attic of your mind.
Once there you may rediscover
the very thing
You have been searching for
Your entire life.
Prepare yourself:
The ghosts will cry and beckon.
But don&amp;rsquo;t run.
Sit and stay awhile.
Get to know yourself.
Offer light
and accept the forgiveness
that soon follows.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exhalation</title><link>/poems/exhalation/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/exhalation/</guid><description>&lt;p>Before there was you

Before there were the stars we claimed as ours

We’re experienced, yes, but the connection

The nets below don’t carry
the weight of our selfish love,

They wonder how we do what we do,
why we take the risks we take,
but we’re just doing our job,
putting on a performance
for an audience of one.
Sometimes we fall
but that’s a part of the deal –
We’re acrobats of the dark she said,
two loose cannons
shooting for the stars,
two trapeze artists vaulting
over loneliness,
two unhinged orbits
ready to collide.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enough</title><link>/poems/enough/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/enough/</guid><description>&lt;p>Cowbells in the distance
Dissonance afar.
Possibility and yearning
Under a sky full of stars.
Somewhere the mountains call
For a fleet-footed boy
To cross them all.
Another day, he said, with bright reassurance
But little did he know
There would be no other occurrence.
Later is a long time to wait
and life took its swing
Along with life he went and gone were his dreams.
Kept hidden and out of sight
He lost them all in a single night.
They returned to the stars above
Waiting for another day
For someone new to look up and say
This is enough.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Seagulls</title><link>/poems/seagulls/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/poems/seagulls/</guid><description>&lt;p>Two birds in unison along a grayed shore walking
