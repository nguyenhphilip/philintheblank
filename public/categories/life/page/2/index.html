I’d catch myself feeling this way but would then be too preoccupied with the residue of my self-frustration to course correct in real time. The result was that I learned and contributed less than I could have had my stance been more open and curious, less debate-y, more dialogic.</p><p>Maybe this is a consequence of my brief stint as an academic. In constantly having to defend and justify my research, I learned that it’s easier to break things down than to build them up. Regardless, it’s not the most pleasant or fruitful way of being. It tends to leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth, a sense of what’s wrong and problematic but no clarity as to what could be.</p></article><article class="list-view list-view--posts"><header><h2 class="title mt--s mb--xxs"><a href=/posts/guitar/>Two years of playing guitar</a></h2><div class="submitted meta"><time class=created-date datetime=2023-01-18T00:00:00Z>18 January 2023</time></div></header><p><strong>Ode to the guitar</strong></p><blockquote><p>Is it the harsh grief</p><p>that pours out of you,</p><p>your thrumming beats, or the</p><p>                    buzzing of wings:

"Dad got it for me," he said in a disinterested tone. Curious, I took it back to my room, looked up some <a href=http://tim.blog/2012/12/11/how-to-play-the-guitar/>guitar basics</a>, and began to play with it. My fingers pulsed with pain and self-hatred by the end of the hour, but a new world had opened up for me.</p></article><article class="list-view list-view--posts"><header><h2 class="title mt--s mb--xxs"><a href=/posts/seeds-2020/>Seeds: Looking back on 2020</a></h2><div class="submitted meta"><time class=created-date datetime=2021-01-17T00:00:00Z>17 January 2021</time></div></header><p><img src=/images/gallery/seeds4.jpg alt></p><p>When I think about the past year, I see a child clad in the slowness of seasons, walking the same path by the same lake in the same woods over and over again, searching for something solid to hang onto, comfort in the familiarity of dirt roads, dressed trees, and footsteps perhaps, certainly meaning, in the face of a reality that has just turned dream-like. Sometimes he stops to skip rocks across the water, hoping they will carry his worries with them.

This is all I will ever be.&rdquo; Sad. Resentful. Despondent. Happy. In truth they are masks, transient facades that hide a more true and vulnerable sense of self.</p><p>We put these masks on when we&rsquo;re scared, when we&rsquo;re too afraid to ask for attention and love; when we&rsquo;re on the verge of breaking, but don&rsquo;t know how to ask for help. When we&rsquo;re in search of something solid in the face of groundlessness. Even happiness is something we try too hard to hold onto, strangling it of all significance in the process.</p></article><nav class=pager><a href=/categories/life/ rel=prev class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><span aria-hidden=true>« </span>Previous</a></nav></main></main></div><style>.site-title{font-size:1.35rem;margin:0 0 1rem;line-height:1;font-weight:400}.site-title a{color:#333;text-decoration:none}body{margin:0;padding:0;font-family:inter,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,segoe ui,Roboto,Oxygen,Ubuntu,Cantarell,fira sans,droid sans,helvetica neue,sans-serif;line-height:1.6;color:#333}.page-container{display:flex;max-width:1200px;margin:0 auto;padding:2rem;gap:4rem}.sidebar{width:200px;flex-shrink:0;position:fixed;padding-top:0}.content{margin-left:250px;max-width:650px}.main-nav ul{list-style:none;padding:0;margin:0}.main-nav li{margin-bottom:.25rem}.main-nav a{color:#4271ae;text-decoration:none;font-size:.9rem}.main-nav a:hover{text-decoration:underline}@media screen and (max-width:768px){.page-container{flex-direction:column;padding:1rem}.sidebar{position:relative;width:100%;margin-bottom:2rem;padding-top:1rem}.content{margin-left:0;width:100%;padding-top:1rem}}</style></body></html>
