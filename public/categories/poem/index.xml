not how he got here.
Let me wonder then:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Did he stumble?
Did his body crumble
at all like
a soggy crepe
held up by sticks
on his way
to some
pre-determined
somewhere?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or did he bumble
like a bee, all grace
&amp;amp; no trace of
a single step,
every toe kissing
the asphalt
as if it were
dirt?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The numbers reveal
one thing while hiding
everything else.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
