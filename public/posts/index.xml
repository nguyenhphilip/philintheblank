      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently started reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.paisleyrekdal.com/real-toads-imaginary-gardens/&#34;&gt;Real Toads, Imaginary Gardens: On Reading and Writing Poetry Forensically&lt;/a&gt; by Paisley Rekdal. I like this book over other “about poetry” books because she approaches it like a forensic scientist, with a focus on craft and process. Gregory Orr’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393253924&#34;&gt;A Primer for Poets &amp;amp; Readers of Poetry&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, moves the Rilkean in me, but it doesn’t quite jive with how I typically build an understanding of things. I like people to take baby steps with me, to really explain, bit by bit, all the elements of a thing and how they hang together. This is true whether it involves math, meditating, or poetry. Sometimes, I need someone to show me how to experience something new.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first exercise I did felt like this. Rekdal focuses on honing what I’ll call “the movements” of reading a poem, the mechanics of what you might want to do upon first encountering a work. Here’s the exercise:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Select one work from the list of shaped or visual poems below and write down all the things you notice about it. Where does your eye go first? How does your eye move around the page? What differences in typeface or font do you notice? What is legible to you and what isn’t? How does the title influence what you see? Are there different kinds and types of language in the poem? Is the poem composed of different kinds of physical material? Is there any relationship you can discover between the shape of the poem and what is being said?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I ended up choosing “hearthead” by Augusto de Campos, just because I liked the title. Here it is below, followed by my (mostly) spontaneous response to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/hearthead.webp&#34; alt=&#34;hearthead by Augusto de Campos&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The outer layer is what hits me first, the &amp;ldquo;he(&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;)ad&amp;rdquo;. My eyes are moving outside in, from left to right, and then I notice the perfect contrast between the yellow text and the red background.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The words &amp;ldquo;art&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;eats&amp;rdquo; are what I see next, and how the words grow smaller and smaller the more inward you look. It feels as if I am looking from a distance, from the distance of the outer layer where &amp;ldquo;head&amp;rdquo; is registered as a word, where my head is registering, something. My head is closer to me, to the outer layer, far away from where the juice of the poem might be. This feels like a dismissal of the poem as a whole, though is the form telling us something about the heart?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I look away and look back quickly. The phrase &amp;ldquo;head in my heart&amp;rdquo; immediately presents itself. This makes me wonder if it’s easier or more difficult to find the reversed phrase &amp;ldquo;heart in my head.&amp;rdquo; The former certainly feels easier to find in a literal sense, in the physical motions of my mind, which is brilliant on the part of Augusto, and also, since poetry is a two-way street, it says something about me, about my heart, maybe. The poem becomes less delightful when I think about it too much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Eats&amp;rdquo; comes back again when I look up, and I laugh. It&amp;rsquo;s like the head has eaten the heart, and art too. The words &amp;ldquo;my&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;he&amp;rdquo; are repeated throughout, and I wonder about their significance. My attention turns toward the parentheses shortly after, reminding me of waves being transmitted from a radio tower. Is the heart like a radio that sends us messages, small and subtle ones that aren’t always easy to hear?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I look at the size of the words and their off-center orientation. Looking at them makes me feel like I am walking down a hallway, or seeing something far away. What is being seen, attempting to be shown? The word &amp;ldquo;my&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;my&amp;rdquo; separating heart into he and art. A tragedy in one sense, but also something beautiful in another: art. He is alone without art. He and art combine to make heart. His heart—the heart—needs art to be complete. It exists separate inside my head.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I move my head back from the screen and recognize there is a difference when writing from my head than my heart. I only scratch the surface, the outer layers, with my head, while everything that comes from my heart is more like art. Look superficially and all you get is the head. It takes a closer to look to find the heart, the art that lives within. But you need both, it seems. Or not. Perhaps the heart is constrained by the head, and sometimes that is what it needs. Art, and life, cannot exist without constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was a really fun exercise for me. Try it! The other poems Rekdal suggests to do this with are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;George Herbert, “Easter Wings” and “The Altar”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Douglas Kearney, “Falling Dark at the Quarters”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Anthony Cody, “Cada día más cerca del fin del mundo”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;mIEKAL aND, “mi’kmaq book of the dead”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Eugene Gomringer, “Silenco” and “o”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Scott Helmes, “haiku #62”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me know how it goes. Happy New Year!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>One month in NYC</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/24-06-28-one-month-nyc/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first two weeks I stayed with a friend in Harlem. It felt longer than that, as is commonly experienced when in the midst of transition, but I didn’t do much aside from read and work, walk around the area surrounding Lenox Ave, and run in Central Park. Mostly I just observed my thoughts and reactions to things. It felt like waiting for a flip to switch to finally start living like a New Yorker. Yeah, I know, I know—waiting is probably the least New Yorker thing to do. But that’s how it went for a little while. I wasn’t in my own place yet, and my wallet was recovering from its recent financial hemorrhaging, meaning that I had to lean on time and the comfort of my old routines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Routines can be surprisingly persistent despite dramatic changes in context. Burlington, VT is nothing like New York City, yet my particular habits and thought patterns remained sticky. My impatience, for one, appeared to be context-independent. In other words, it’s a (lovable) &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt; of mine. I was closer than I thought to becoming a New Yorker, perhaps. But I moved to change and grow god damn it! So why was I still so impatient? Even the novelty of my move couldn’t keep it at bay for long.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After I moved and settled in Greenpoint, my usual neuroses creeped into the fray like the gradual heat of summer. Before I knew it I was sweating in the same old ways, over the same old stuff, again. Loneliness and sadness, my unwavering companions. Fear of insignificance and lack of direction. Anxiety over making new friends. Past relationship patterns masquerading as personality traits. Wherever we go, there we are.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s true that the city is full of infinite possibilities. Bars and bookshops in one; restaurants that aren’t afraid to burn the midnight oil; bouldering gyms with climbing walls on their rooftops (okay maybe just &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vitalclimbinggym.com/brooklyn&#34;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;); anarchist birding clubs fighting to revitalize our attention. Excess and brilliance abound: you can have it all if you want it hard enough, so it goes. Who are you here without desire?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What’s also true is that possibility is a bitch. That I was constantly in close proximity to people but not actually connecting with anyone magnified the loneliness I felt on the daily. This made showing up to classes and events I planned on attending more difficult. I feared that people would see how lonely I was, how needy I felt, and not want to interact with me. Vermont came to mind in these moments, but not as much as I thought I would. I knew I needed to be here, partially to witness the familiar ways I was suffering, so that I could learn to better soothe and befriend it all. My meditation practice has certainly helped, and pretty soon I did begin to meet people, many of whom I felt an immediate kinship with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At a poetry gathering centered on the work of Diane Suess I felt only slightly nervous in voicing my musings. Later in the week I workshopped my relationship to conflict and rejection with a group of like-minded strangers. I also started learning Brazilian jiu-jitsu and even brought along a friend I had recently met at a picnic. Alongside a bunch of rebellious urbanites at a nearby park I spent two hours trailing the songs and trajectories of common birds. All of which is to say: things have been great, challenging in the best ways possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness transforms into solitude when you cease the struggle against it. That’s harder to do in the city, which is constantly reminding you that connection is a mere train ride away. But also, while you’re here, maybe you should keep dancing with that beauty named possibility. She’s worth the company of loneliness, who ultimately wants to dance with you as well. Solitude, too, is in fact a mere seven hour train ride away, should I hear his call. For now, I feel, the city is welcoming me. I’m allowed to stay and say I belong here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8195448b-1f3d-4ba7-bf0a-516800d66caf_4032x3024.heic&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Reflections on Moving</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/24-05-23-reflections-moving/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s not news to those close to me (or to anyone who pays attention to my tweets), but I’m moving—to NYC!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Burlington, Vermont has been my home for over six years. It’s the longest I’ve lived in a single place since graduating from college. I love it here! My neighbors on the block greet me by name. The people are incredibly kind and friendly. It’s beautiful and walkable. There are discernible seasons. The great Lake Champlain, steadfast witness and beholder of much of my growth and pain, is a pleasant ten-minute saunter away from my apartment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet, I feel ready for something different. I want to be surrounded by more than undergrads and a handful of families. I want a bit more drama and social interestingness (just a wee bit). I want to be thrown in &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; city of cities and to find more of my people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At least that’s what I tell myself. In truth it’s not totally clear what my motivations are. I parrot the above reasons to anyone who asks, but they are hardly more than flimsy mappings of amorphous intuitions. &lt;em&gt;What&lt;/em&gt; will I be doing? &lt;em&gt;Who&lt;/em&gt; arethe people I’m looking for? I don’t quite know yet, and that’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tend to want to feel perfectly aligned with my choices before making any big decisions. Any inkling of fear, doubt, or discomfort means that I should introspect more until everything is settled. Yet it’s rarely the case that we ever reach this state prior to taking the leap. Nor do we need to in order to live well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd8e7727-191e-48d1-be65-ea3955e0819d_4032x3024.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbd8e7727-191e-48d1-be65-ea3955e0819d_4032x3024.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before I considered moving, I sensed that something needed to change in the way that I lived. I had an abundance of freedom and flexibility with my job, leaving me plenty of time to indulge in my personal projects. So I read and wrote. I sang and played guitar. I lounged around dreamily in coffee shops. It was everything I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then it wasn’t. It got stale and meaningless really quickly. I wondered if I needed deeper friendships or work that was more challenging. I then started hosting the occasional gathering and introduced many of my friends to one another. I participated more frequently in various online and offline groups. I also traveled more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From Portland, Oregon to Asheville, North Carolina; from SF to NYC—every place I visited affected me differently. A small handful inspired a sense of magic that I felt had been absent, while others felt like more of the same. What I hadn’t realized that I could feel so different, &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; so different until I had a change of scenery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This shouldn’t have surprised me, but it did. I’d spent so long in a single place engaged in a world of my own—a world mostly consisting of text, abstractions, and daydreams—that a basic fact of selfhood had been forgotten. I needed others, and I wanted to participate more fully in the world. My lease renewal was coming up, and I asked myself if I wanted to live here for another year. That’s when NYC became a real possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’d thought about moving to NYC before, but it always seemed like a fantasy I didn’t actually want. My visits were always inspiring and magical, but also draining and excessive. It felt like a place for brilliants and creatives to light both ends of midnight candle until they burned out and moved elsewhere, not somewhere that people &lt;em&gt;lived&lt;/em&gt;. My fears spoke to me loud and clearly: I could never make it in the city. It only allowed entry to those who wanted it badly enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, I kept meeting people who consistently encouraged me and made me feel like I belonged. People from my Twitter circle. People from my online meditation community. People from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://interintellect.com/&#34;&gt;Interintellect&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone I knew and talked to thought it was a good idea. The only thing holding me back, it seemed, was a fear of not being good-smart-interesting enough; that I didn’t have the drive or energy to be a “real” New Yorker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also feared not being able to find what Vermont has given me. Here I can walk for miles along the nearby lake with a deep loneliness in my heart, only to later discover that solitude has decided to accompany me on the way back home. From Erazim Kohák’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/317739.The_Embers_and_the_Stars&#34;&gt;The Embers and the Stars&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness is the condition of feeling abandoned amid an alien world, cut off from communication. Solitude is the condition of being alone in the presence of a living, familiar world, willing to listen to it, to see and to understand it in &lt;em&gt;Einfühlung&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Eindeutung&lt;/em&gt;, sharing in its feel and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What follows is a sense of reconnection, my pain being held and absorbed by what Kohák calls “the moral sense of nature.” These moments feel like grace in the truest sense of the word, like something you completely surrender to when you understand you are in the presence of something sacred.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am afraid of losing this, of drowning in the excess of human constructs and artifacts without a &lt;a href=&#34;https://onbeing.org/poetry/go-to-the-limits-of-your-longing/&#34;&gt;hand&lt;/a&gt; to reach for. I’m scared I won’t be able to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/07/02/amanda-palmer-reads-wislawa-szymborska/&#34;&gt;keep up with the pace that the action demands.&lt;/a&gt; Though a friend who has lived there likes to remind me that NYC has everything for everyone, even the grace of solitude. Kohák again:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is not a matter of “learning to live without others,” but rather of learning to live with nature &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;others, not outshouting them with our insistent presence, but being instead ready to see and hear, in love and respect. For, in understanding as in sense perception, it is when we stop speaking that we begin to hear; when we stop staring, things emerge before our eyes; when we stop insisting on our explanations, we can begin to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Portland, Oregon was the other place I considered. I really liked it there, how it felt like a bigger version of Burlington with its balance of city and lush landscapes. It’s closer to my parents and family too, as well as the university where I work. There’s something peaceful about it. And yet…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NYC is a city that evokes a certain kind of doubt, the kind of doubt that springs from an undefinable but obvious love. &lt;em&gt;There are too many people!&lt;/em&gt; And yet… &lt;em&gt;The rent’s too expensive!&lt;/em&gt; And yet… &lt;em&gt;There aren’t enough trees!&lt;/em&gt; And yet… I’m over romanticizing a bit, but that’s exactly what’s so alluring about the city. It welcomes romantics and dreamers like me into its all-consuming arms. I want to find out what will emerge on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a20ec69-32db-48ad-a355-fd7d2a31e81e_1024x1024.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5a20ec69-32db-48ad-a355-fd7d2a31e81e_1024x1024.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The magic of NYC is undeniable. I was virtually assaulted by images, ideas, and lines of poetry the last time I was there, all within the span of a five minute walk somewhere in the Upper West Side. It was a beautiful, dizzying dance between my mind, my heart, and the city. I want to understand what it’s all about in the deepest sense, with the hope that some of it will rub off on me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All my previous moves were for employment reasons. Even where I went to school for my undergraduate and graduate degrees was constrained by circumstance. That’s why this move feels so big. It clearly embodies the fact that I have total responsibility over the rest of my life. The guard rails of pre-defined paths have disappeared, as has the voice of convention. No one can save me from myself. It’s scary, yes, but also wildly life-affirming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To move is to learn to trust the world in motion, to allow ourselves to be guided by the rich, vivid texture of experience rather than our out dated projections. I can study the map of a place all day. I can even visit and obtain a cardiogram of its heartbeat. But to live there, to be &lt;em&gt;part of&lt;/em&gt; a place, to contribute to its ongoing arrhythmia, that is something else entirely. That requires a leap of faith, a level of commitment that takes you beyond what anyone of us can ever predict.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Hey doc. Good to see you again. It’s been a minute. Your hair’s looking great by the way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Thanks. You always say that you know, so let me remind you that I do in fact just wake up like this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Millions around the world envy you doc, including yours truly. Anyways, enough with the small talk. I got a problem. I keep trying to get back together with Purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Again?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah. I’ve been feeling extra lost and lonely, so I thought I might call him and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: And? What happened?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Sigh.&lt;/em&gt; You know, the usual roundabout stuff. We talk, even flirt and tease each other a bit, for old times sake. Well, one thing leads to the next and before you know it, he’s luring me out of my mild existence again with an ecstatic vision of what my life could be!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I try to resist and remind myself that my life is pretty good, but it’s no use. In the end I take the bait and bite. I fall hard and chase after him as if he were the answer to all my dissatisfactions. Meanwhile the rest of my life falls apart, deepening my need for him. “If I don’t find him,” my brain tells me, “then I’ll have nothing. I’ll be nothing. And life won’t be worth living.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Whoa, okay. That last part is new.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah. It’s scary. But I can’t stop looking for him. It will only compound the shame I feel for continuing to remain Purposeless. What will people think of me after ignoring them for so long to continue my fruitless searching? I just can’t—I won’t stop until Purpose is a part of my life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Have you ever watched Lord of the Rings?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, of course. I binged all of the movies once when I was in a depressed funk. Why?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Because you sound like Gollum right now, that twisted little hobbit who turned crazy because of his obsession with the ring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Ah, that guy. Totally relatable. MY PRECIOUS, MY PURPOSE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Don’t ever do that finger-clicking thing again. And stop cackling like that. It’s creepy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: I KNOW DOC. I know. It’s bad. You gotta help me out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Come back in a week. I’ll have a treatment plan by then. In the meantime cool it on the Lord of the Rings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F918658b4-8f0e-42d6-8a29-03d597928133_500x552.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;My precious…&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Hey doc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Welcome back Phil. Let’s get to it. How are your relationships?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Hang on doc. I thought we were going to solve my Purpose problem. How are my relationships relevant?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, sometimes people go looking for Purpose when what they’re really suffering from is a deep form of loneliness, existential or otherwise. You mentioned last week that this is something your struggling with, so that’s where we’ll start. Do you have people in your life who you feel close with? Family? Friends?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Admittedly, no. My parents and siblings live across the country. I have a few friends, but none that I feel close with. Sometimes I get drinks with Bobby and Bibi, but I don’t really open up to them about anything in particular. There’s my cat, Georgia, who I love dearly, though it’s never clear how she feels about me. Cats, you know how they are. Oh—and don’t even get me started on dating in the 21st century. It’s a minefield destined for recurring heartbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m sure Georgia loves you very much. Say more about Bobby and Bibi though. Why don’t you open up to them?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m afraid of what they’ll think of me, especially if I let my true colors show. Exhibit A: I can be both hypercritical and extremely sensitive. Exhibit B: I spend most of my time meditating, daydreaming, reading books I struggle to understand, walking around the city without aim. Exhibit C: small talk bothers me to no end.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Have you tried opening up to them before? How does it feel?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Sort of. I joked to Bobby the other day that my default expectation in forming new relationships is disappointment. Isn’t that sad doc?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: That’s a vulnerable sentiment, more than some people allow themselves to be. How did he respond?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: He… he looked at me with what seemed like genuine concern and asked me to say more about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: And? What did you say?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: I changed the subject! It was hard for me to go deeper than that. I’ve always been able to intellectualize how I feel, but expressing the emotional side of things remains a struggle, partially because it’s not always clear what I even want to say. There’s a wall that comes up whenever I’m on the verge of a breakthrough. In the end I must come off like a mute bimbo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Do you feel safe and welcomed around Bobby?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Sometimes. I mean, he’s not always the most attentive person, which annoys me. He’ll ask me a question and then get distracted by a woman or something else, treating what I say like mere entertainment, a way of passing the time. I feel unheard as a result. My response is to retreat into myself, but I can’t do that for too long, otherwise I start to feel isolated again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Have you told him any of what you just told me?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Hell no! What’s the point if he isn’t going to listen?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, he might. Consider the possibility that he’s grown accustomed to your squirminess as it relates to opening up. When he expressed genuine concern about your expected disappointment in new relationships, you said you changed the subject, right? I’m sure he does get distracted from time to time when you speak, but it’s also possible that he’s used to you distracting yourself from the heart of the matter. Perhaps he’s come to expect that you won’t open up and be authentic with him, so why should he be fully attentive?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Well… ouch, but that’s very possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m not saying this is exactly what’s happening, but I do want to put the ball back in your court.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: So how does this all relate to Purpose?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Sometimes people overlook the small things they need to focus on when they’re fixated on Purpose, even though the small things may be just as important. In fact, they might be more important depending on the situation. Let’s call the “small” things little-p purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Big Purpose can get in the way of your little-p purposes by acting as a device of wish-fulfillment, a fantasy that you indulge yourself in when you don’t want to deal with what’s in front of you. Regarding Bobby, it sounds like he really wanted to get to know you, but you shied away from the opportunity. You shielded yourself from him. You avoided the task that was presented to you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Are you saying that connecting with Bobby was my little-p purpose in that moment?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Precisely. It’s not as sexy as unlocking the secrets of the universe or becoming a Pulitzer-winning fantasy novelist. But it was what life had asked of you right then and there. Life presents us with opportunities to improve the world all the time, often beginning with ourselves. We may recognize that our health isn’t doing so hot, that our social lives are non-existent, that we hate our jobs. Well, that recognition is Purpose speaking to us. It’s letting us know that something needs to change, something very immediately connected to our lives, right in that moment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: I get where you’re going doc. All of that stuff is so boring though. How does any of it relate to finding Purpose?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: If Purpose knocked on your door tomorrow and gave himself to you, what would you do with him? Would you know how to listen, how to respond with skill and grace? Would he flourish in your life as it currently stands? What I’m about to say might be too woo-y for you, but I believe that Purpose will reveal himself to you when you’re ready. And he’ll know that you’re ready when he sees that you can take care of your little-p purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: I take your point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: When I was younger I also had a problem with Purpose. I felt that I wanted to create something great that would inspire and change people’s lives, but mine wasn’t in great shape. I had to focus on my life first before Purpose could reveal himself to me. Otherwise I would have just fucked it all up. This meant that I had to work with my unoriginal thoughts and ideas, to write with what I knew then, which was close to nothing. But you don’t need much to work with what you got. You simply start from where you are. I also learned, perhaps too late, that I needed good friends, people who I could go deep with, people I could trust to stick around for the ups and downs, people who I truly enjoyed being around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;None of it was easy, but it did feel purposeful—making friends and building friendships, writing every day. Even my boring day job took on a new feeling of purpose as soon as I started focusing on what I could do rather than what I couldn’t, on the problems no one else seemed to notice. All of my efforts eventually led me to other pursuits and job opportunities, to significant people, but I never could have predicted any of it had I remained fixated on finding Purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: You make it sound so easy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s really quite simple, but not always easy. In fact it only gets harder. As you become more purposeful and capable, the share of your responsibilities is increased. Life asks more of you the more you continue to serve it because it knows you can handle it. It needs you, just as much as you need it. Certain pleasures may be lost in the process, but the depth, variety, and richness of your life more than makes up for what at first seems like a loss.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Did you ever do it then? Did you ever write something that changed the world?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, not exactly in the ways I imagined as a kid. I grew to enjoy writing, and others enjoyed what I wrote. But I never got a book deal. I never published a best-selling novel. Still, I’ve managed to write for my blog over the past few decades, and that’s felt like enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: And it’s led you to people like me, ha. Loonies who just can’t seem to eat their veggies and appreciate their friends at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Phil&lt;/strong&gt;: Right. And I wouldn’t give any of this up for anything. I’ll see you next week.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Eclipsing</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/24-04-09-eclipse/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/24-04-09-eclipse/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3550f960-b07e-4776-9da2-880d3032c550.heic&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Six months ago, I was reading something about gravity and tidal systems. Along the way I learned that the moon is predicted to drift out of Earth’s orbit at some point in the far future. This led me to content on solar eclipses, and that’s how I ended up with a set of 25 eclipse glasses. Little ol’ Vermont was plotted in the path of totality. There was no way in hell I would miss this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For both better and worse, I’m inclined to find and give meaning to everything around me. I’m sure it has something to do with my spirituality and meditation practice, as well as my struggle to keep language at bay when faced with boredom and uncertainty. Whatever the case, the eclipse is exciting partially because one doesn’t have to look too far for grander meanings, for the comfort of cosmic universals. One only has to look up toward the sky at the right time, equipped with nothing more than a cheap piece of specialized eyewear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the one hand the eclipse is another predictable event of the cosmos, just like the sunrise. We know with near-perfect precision when the moon will begin to cross the sun, when the sun will be completely covered, when and where the next total eclipse will take place. This makes it unsurprising and possibly meaningless to some. I was walking in my neighborhood when I overheard a man ask the nearby students what all the sudden activity in the city was about, as if it had bloomed unexpectedly out of the blue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, thousands of visitors will pay premium for overpriced Airbnbs all over Vermont to experience the brief spectacle. Millions more elsewhere will do the same, waiting for the exact moment when the Earth is completely shadowed. It means nothing; it means everything. It’s all a matter of perspective, which eclipses are notorious for granting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had wanted to watch the eclipse at a nearby graveyard on the outskirts of my neighborhood, where the trees are tall and glorious and varied. I later learned that this was an ideal environment for catching some of the crescent-shaped shadows and projections of the sun. The caretakers must have known this: the gates were locked when I scoped them out on my morning walk. Where I ended up was on the rooftop of my friend’s apartment complex, which was nice too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We arrived toward the beginning of the eclipse, an hour before totality. Small talk bubbled through the warm Spring air; snacks and laughs were shared beneath a blue and mostly cloudless sky. Periodically we looked up to check the position of the moon. Its ascent was coming from the bottom-right, at 5 o’clock of the sun. The excitement was palpable, and I was happy to be with my friends. But a part of me also wanted to be alone. It’s the ancient impulse of the seeker. Liminal states give way to transcendence more easily when he is on his own. I’m still learning every day how to simply enjoy the company of others, to allow for a social kind of sacredness to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The cold got to us before we noticed the cast of the moon shadow over the land. For me it was the birds that signaled something was shifting significantly. Their songs turned into unpredictable calls. They then began flying in strange patterns. I saw one fly straight up into the sky for a few seconds before suddenly diving back down toward safer ground. Others flew from tree to tree like pinballs in perpetual play. Chatter and commentary surrounded me, but I was losing touch with it. I wanted nothing more than silence and the slow surrender of daylight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Soon came the gasps of excitement, the incomprehensible whispers, the whispered hushing. We knew exactly what was happening, but it still seized us by the throat. The sun was engulfed. All that remained was a hole in the sky, a perfect corona flaring. Its rays surrounded us on all sides, forming a ring that lit both building and mountain range in equal brilliance. The sun was setting everywhere. We stood at its dark center, the luckiest of us less self and selfless, no longer the center of the universe. It was over in three minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How quickly we were to fill the void. How quickly and easily we filled the air with our voices and meanings. Well-intentioned, maybe, but hurried, perhaps. In a rush to make sense of things with the finality of language. Wordless, we find words that bring us to talk. Talk of plans. Talk of the ensuing traffic. Talk of happiness without further lingering. Friends asked me how it was, as if it were already over, as if my feelings and thoughts were contained within the three minute totality. I had nothing to say, nothing important really. And I had no clue as to how I was feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t over yet for me, and that was my cue to go. I wanted to walk—not to process my feelings, but to give space for whatever else decided to emerge, to linger a little longer in the silence. I walked down to the water and found a vacant tree to sit under, away from the crowds. A family from Israel walked by and greeted me. “Happy eclipse day,” they said, and I smiled back. The birds were singing again, just like they do when they wake up at last.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Craft, Coffee, and Collier</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F10462807-8d1b-44c6-baef-db94cd4e739c_1200x1800.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was sitting at the bar of my favorite coffee shop, chatting with the owner about his philosophy on business and craft coffee. Like many artists, he wasn’t wholly concerned about creating something that everyone would like. He simply wanted to make experimental, high-quality coffee. This is a stance that polarizes the feedback he receives—people either love or hate his offerings—but he gets to stay true to his culinary visions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The regulars appreciate this and have formed a kind of transient but consistent community. It wasn’t his intention to draw in a crowd, to “build community” as the kids like to say, but it happened anyways. The same has been said to occur by many other creatives. When you’re focused on creating what you want to see in the world it will attract the right people, those who can feel and taste what it is that you’re really up to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What else is like this? The unintentional effect, consequence, product of simply focusing on what you love?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jacob Collier has been my recent obsession. He’s deemed by some as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7rvDA3MARk&#34;&gt;Mozart of Gen Z&lt;/a&gt;, which sounds like hyperbole. His music certainly isn’t for everyone. But listen to the range and variety between his solo NPR &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJR6XSSKi-g&#34;&gt;Tiny Desk&lt;/a&gt; performance and the Mahogany Sessions of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQvzX0Z3HE4&#34;&gt;Little Blue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVMtxmUjFc&#34;&gt;Summer Rain&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not his technical prowess (though he certainly has it) that arrests me, but rather his use of harmony and connection to the musical whole.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Watching him perform, especially in Little Blue, one gets the sense that he sees and feels things the rest of us do not. It’s as if another dimension of consciousness is available to him, from which he pulls and strings together his compositions. Around the &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/IQvzX0Z3HE4?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=285&#34;&gt;4:45&lt;/a&gt; mark he begins to lift his fans toward some higher plane of musical existence. He guides them to feel and visualize the relation between notes using only his hands and the sound of his voice, ultimately producing something like a pop-up orchestra. All great musicians are tapped into the musical matrix in much the same manner. But to know how to connect others to it is something else. It’s mesmerizing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WknTbYOet4c&#34;&gt;learning the guitar&lt;/a&gt;, Collier adopted his own tuning (and dropped from a six to a five string!) to make it work for him and his musical creations. I’m more locked into the standard chord shapes and patterns I learned, so when I play and write songs it sounds, well, standard. It’s familiar even to our desensitized, over-stimulated ears. Switching to a non-standard tuning has helped with variety, but it doesn’t improve my understanding or connection to the music itself. This requires more practice with translating the music that come to mind in states of daydreaming and boredom, rather than starting from what I know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What you know can limit you in much the same way it enables you. The instruments are simply thus, tools in service of the wildness and music inside all of us. Collier is one of the few in direct communion with his soul, creating things that allow us to come closer to ours. It’s always there, shaping our thoughts, moods, and actions, waiting to be heard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

I’m going to start publishing a less polished version of my blog. Hopefully it’ll be more personal too. This is inspired by Hua Hsu, a writer who wrote a recent favorite read of mine, “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/25/books/review/stay-true-hua-hsu.html&#34;&gt;Stay True&lt;/a&gt;.” It’s a beautiful memoir, one centered on a formative friendship and its tragic loss. Full of poignant observations and the musings of someone who can never say enough, it’s my kind of read.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many moments in the book stand out—his notes on art and craft, his deceptively simple and relatable descriptions of pre-2k life, the gravity of his grief and guilt in the aftermath of his friend Ken’s senseless murder—but it’s his obsession with analysis that I’m drawn to and the nature of his friendship with Ken.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To Hua, Ken was the epitome of mainstream. He’s a sociable, handsome, well-liked frat boy. He listened to Pearl Jam and shopped at Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch. He dated and dated conventionally pretty white women, a true mark of Japanese American assimilation. He was everything Hua was not. He was &lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ken was cool in a way that had nothing to do with mastering random, arcane fields of knowledge. He was comfortable with himself, whether this meant chatting up girls at frat parties or accompanying me to the record store, and passing back and forth seemed to require no effort on his part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hua defined himself mostly in terms of negative space, his dislikes and social loathings, his desire to be special and subversive. He created zines. He made mixtapes. He was above physical attraction. Being cool—being Hua Hsu—meant avoiding everything and anything that everyone else found cool. It meant being the opposite of Ken.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whenever he expressed skepticism toward the status quo, I felt a tiny measure of victory—&lt;em&gt;Join me on the side of cynical despair!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite their differences, the two grew to love each other—or maybe more accurately, Hua learned to love Ken. Hua realized that Ken was in fact thoughtful and discerning, despite initial impressions. They spent a lot of time together, often staying up late to “subtext-mine” whatever film, book, or music they were obsessed with. Neither felt quite at home in America, and this was their method of gaining the privilege of narrative. Perhaps by understanding how this point in history came to be, they could then etch their own stories into the world. Hua learned, slowly, that he wasn’t above Pearl Jam, or physical attraction to women.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everybody likes something—a song, a movie, a TV show—so you choose not to; this is how you carve out a space for yourself. But the right person persuades you to try it, and you feel as though you’ve made two discoveries. One is that this thing isn’t so bad. The other is a new confidant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after finishing Hua’s memoir, I caught up with a friend who lives in Hungary. We’ve been friends for seven years now. She was a mess when I met her, to put it as she would in blunt Eastern European terms. I was, in my own way, too. So it was a gift to experience her lightness and humor despite being recently fired. An event like this would have sent her spiraling down to hell years ago. Instead she felt more sure and confident of herself than I had ever previously witnessed. She reflected back to me all the ways I had grown as well. The best of friendships are mirrors, and we are made in their image.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I thought of Hua and Ken after my call. Their friendship was cut short too soon. And yet, even in his absence, Ken continued to shape Hua and his life. He spent the next twenty years perfecting the art of description and criticism, thinking of and writing the memoir. And now their story is with me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I envy the closeness and intimacy they have. It’s the thing I want and have struggled with most in my own relationships. It’s part of why I write this blog. I want you to witness the way my mind turns. I want you to see me in my fullness and not turn away. I want to share space with you—and occasionally fill it up with semi-smart digressions that make the sometimes lonely hours reading alone worth it. I want you to ask me what I’m thinking about, even if it’s about nothing. I want you to remember me, sitting in the room, strumming my guitar, with a head full of heart and a heart full of music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you’re young, you do so many things hoping to be noticed. The way you dress or stand, the music played loud enough to catch the attention of another person who might know a song, too. And then there are things you do as you step out into the world, the real world full of strange adults, testing out what it means to be generous or thoughtful. In that instant, before every memory was placed along some narrative arc, before the act of remembering took on a desperate air, I simply felt lucky to witness something so effortlessly kind—to see my friend do something that was good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Awareness</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/24-02-27-awareness/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98d9bf7a-bd97-403e-9374-8c75edb9610e_576x680.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve become more aware of certain things about myself. Which is strange. I don’t know how to make sense of this new information, or what to do with it, if anything. It’s always been there, in the sense that the signals are the same. How I hold and relate to them is different though, which changes their intensity and nature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For instance, I&amp;rsquo;m realizing that my fantasy of becoming a therapist has mostly been just that, a fantasy. It&amp;rsquo;s associated with specific sensations and moments, moments often characterized by loneliness and a lack of direction. This is where my thoughts go whenever I feel creatively stuck or unsure about how long I want to stick around in my current job. What I want is clarity and certainty, which can take the form of a career path. Funnily enough, this is the direction of disintegration for the enneagram four. When they struggle they become more like a two, The Helper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Certain experiences validated these reflections. I began volunteering on a “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.seekhealing.org/&#34;&gt;listening line&lt;/a&gt;” not long ago and learned that I didn’t enjoy it as much as I thought I would. What I liked was exploring idea space through conversation and being attuned to others, not so much directly helping people. This bothered me at first—&lt;em&gt;how dare I not want to help people!&lt;/em&gt;—but I knew that there are other ways of doing so, without needing to become a therapist. Moreover, I was reacting from a place of fear and a desire for security rather than curiosity and excitement. Not exactly the motivations I look for when I turn to someone for help. Who I really wanted to help was myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s embarrassing to admit. I’ve dangled the idea of therapy in front of me for so long that I feel somewhat empty without its domineering presence. The same can be said of my romantic fantasies. My days aren’t as warped by lust or daydreams of immaculate encounters with beautiful women in coffee shops. Even my ambitions have taken a back seat—more specifically, the sense of urgency I feel to do something interesting and worthwhile with my time. It’s not that I don’t want to do cool or worthwhile things. It’s just that I know I’ll be okay if they don’t amount to anything, if they don’t fit into some half-baked image of success. What this has made room for, it seems, is space. Space for my quieter desires to emerge, space for a more authentic self.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I didn’t have much guidance with regard to, well, anything. My inner life was left mostly unexplored by my peers and parents. No one taught me how to have difficult conversations, nor was I really encouraged in any pursuit. The only things I liked were video games and hanging out with my childhood friends. I eventually lost connection to the latter because I moved around a lot, which made me anchor in the digital world. There I was highly competent and developed a sense of self. People wanted me on their team and valued my perspective on the game. I loved the online friends I made despite our differences in age and background (I was always the youngest). Outside of this world I felt like a nobody, like one the heartless beings from Kingdom Hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my last year of high school, I had a psychology teacher who inadvertently gave me a sense of direction. He had worked as a banker in a past life and told us that he was paid much less now. This didn’t compute in my adolescent brain at the time: why would someone leave a higher paying job for a lower paying one? Over time, I came to see that he genuinely liked what he was doing, and that this was one of the most important things in the world to get right. No other adult had shown that to me. No other adult seemed happy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He had also planted a curiosity in my young mind that bloomed when it came time to think about college: if I didn’t know what I wanted to do to make me happy, maybe I could study people and their brains and understand my own well enough to rightly decide what career I was meant for. Little did I know that my naive self wasn’t far off from what actual psychologists do and think about—I wanted to predict the future, given a set of variables and assumptions. I also didn’t yet know that academic psychologists hardly knew a thing about happiness, and that I could be happy independent of the career I had.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In retrospect I wish someone had told me about the poor mental model I was working with. But it did bring me here. It did introduce me to Buddhism and interesting people, to books and ideas and experiences I would’ve never had if any other variable in the system had been altered. I’m also more aware of what I did not receive as a budding human, which is its own gift. There is less a need to imagine myself as anything other than I am, which happens to free the imagination for other pursuits. I’m simply here in the midst of it all, experiencing the ebb and flow of existence. It’s fifty-five degrees outside on a February day in Vermont. There is a dullness, yes. And there is a complete, embodied aliveness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Reflections on a story</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/24-02-15-reflections-story/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 15 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6598873e-c2ef-47c3-9baf-3c5026b92026.heic&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I’ve experimented with different forms of writing. I’ve written poems, essays, personal posts, and more recently fiction. I’ve never written fiction before, and needless to say, it’s been incredibly frustrating. This has me thinking about my relationship to writing, and the point of writing this story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the day, my head is full of semi-random ideas and impressions. They usually have some basis in a problem I’ve been thinking about, a recurring feeling, or something else that seems intangibly relevant to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One such impression came to me when I was taking the train down to NYC. I was staring out the window at some clouds, wondering about nothing in particular. I then thought it’d be interesting to live up there, if it were possible. What would that really be like? That’s when Sid came to mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sid lives a precarious existence because his life is built upon the nebulosity of clouds. They are constantly changing, and as a result, he has no friends. He has no steady sense of home, and he doesn’t even know who his parents are. The cloud dwellers live in a state of constant drift, hoping one day to be graced by stability. Most of all Sid yearns to be like the mountains, like the ancient trees that he observes daily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later, Sid meets Amelia, a motherly pilot who raises him on Earth’s surface after a chance encounter brings them together. She teaches him how to fly planes and identify cloud formations. She shows him the stars and all the hidden wonders beyond the sky. Sid is enamored and falls in love with his newfound life, but it isn’t long before his primordial yearning returns. Looking into the vastness of the sky reminds him of something lost, of something that has always been out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He wants to go back. He wants to reconnect to his original roots. And yet he also feels that Amelia is his refuge, that Earth is his home. Here are his mountains. Here are the forests that protect him from constant exposure to the elements, unlike the clouds. Every choice has its tradeoffs, she says to him one day while handing him her plane keys. Will you continue dreaming or will you fly? And here the story ends.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I like this caricature of my story more than what it currently is as a work of fiction. It feels more natural to write in this way, as a form of reflection. I suppose I’ve always written for this reason alone, to better understand myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it isn’t obvious, I am reflected in Sid, a kid who is intimate with longing. Part of me wants to move somewhere new at this point in life, try something different, grow into someone I’m unfamiliar with. And yet, having moved around so much, constantly bouncing between various pursuits, people, and projects, I know the cost of living in the clouds. I know the pain of never feeling quite certain about anything. My head is often elsewhere, in a safe space of my imagining, dealing with abstractions, navigating impressions, playing with myself. This fuels my yearning for something like what Amelia represents: steadiness, stability, connection, community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The trick is knowing how to balance the two. My spiritual practice helps with this—living with uncertainty, maintaining awareness of emptiness. But there are also times when one must lean head first into each side of the duality. It’s okay to play around with the ephemeral for awhile, to dream and daydream, even if they never manifest as a fully-formed cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is a cloud anyways but a matter of perspective? It’s both a thing and nothing at the same time. Knowing this brings me straight back to the truth of reality. It is the home that has always been there, no matter where I go.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t be sad, be Enneagram Type 4 instead</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7044b9fc-4ebe-46f3-9b84-e4c343fc3acc_1024x1024.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In response to Sasha Chapin’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/talking-enneagram-7-blues?publication_id=78415&amp;amp;post_id=141442583&amp;amp;isFreemail=true&amp;amp;r=khqqq&#34;&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt; on his enneagram type, I thought I’d add to the Type of Guy literature by describing my type, the four.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ah, the four: Champion of melancholy. Sommelier of solitude. He is the hopeless romantic. He is the depressed artist who redeems himself in &lt;a href=&#34;https://philintheblank.substack.com/p/being-held-by-the-world&#34;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;. He is grand and grandiose, brilliant and utterly insufferable, often in the span of a single breath. (See: Sommelier of solitude.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One must imagine meeting Rilke for the first time, innocently asking him for the time and weather. You may find yourself instead voyaging through hell on the wings of an incandescent angel, unable to grasp or resist the terror and sublimity that overcomes the entirety of your being, as he whispers poetica into your ears. You’re disoriented and want to keep away. All you wanted was the time of day. And yet, you feel that there is something irresistible about him. You can’t name it and therefore comprehend him, which is what he wants to avoid. You can only watch as he pulls you in like a moth to his flame. He is a spectacle to behold but never to hold, a dying star held in constant tension by the gravity of his inner depths and the desire to transcend himself entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He surfs both waves of ecstasy and abysses of despair, searching for the current that will finally bring him home. Except that, when he finds himself on the shoreline, he willingly jumps back into the ocean and lets the tide take him elsewhere, until the longing returns. Home is what he needs, but longing is what he subconsciously wants. This deep longing—for belonging, for connection to something greater than himself, for the penultimate love—has roots in loss, often early in life, so it goes. It is both the siren song of his suffering and the muse of his creativity, which is why he feels he cannot live without it. Constant discontent, then, is a prominent feature of his life. He has trouble appreciating the mundane, living in the moment, seeing that everything is, in a sense, already perfect. Something always seems missing, and he often feels estranged from the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Music and art, metaphor and symbol, realms transcendent and his imagination are thus a sanctuary. Here he can overcome the missingness and his fear of inadequacy and personal insignificance through the richness of his inner life. Here he can become whoever he wants while riding the high of his reveries. This is not the same as what he really yearns for, but it’s easier to sustain a self built upon visions and fantasies than it is to interface with the messiness of reality. Should his image be discovered for what it truly is, he will retreat and regress further inward like an ouroboros until he is fully consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This act of internal self-creation cannot go on forever in isolation. He cannot get out of hell on his own, even with the help of incandescent angels. The wholeness he seeks is co-created in the dance between inner and outer, in seeing that the division was always illusory. He must recognize that he needs direct contact with the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Knowing this, he begins to live for something beyond himself. He subjects himself to more than the whims of his fleeting impressions and feelings. Inside is constantly in conversation with reality, and he is created in the process. The works he may happen to produce, the effect he has on others, all of it becomes a reflection of who he really is. His fear of insignificance is made insignificant in the light of his entanglements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even Rilke was not free from the hands of time. He was born into the world and died a part of it. Had he not integrated his inner life with the outer world, we may not have appreciated the subtle sorrows of an autumn day. We may not have felt the urgency to change our lives when confronted with the truth of beauty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The four: he is Rilke. He is Elliott Smith in his &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4cJv6s_Yjw&#34;&gt;bathroom&lt;/a&gt;, actualizing the potential he’ll never see. He is me, looking to be made significant in the eyes of God. Notice me, senpai Sasha.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc585054f-2679-4e66-a80c-6b600ff07e4e.heic&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the sauna, he smiles and greets me with the warmth of a thousand suns, as if all of South Africa had been condensed into a bottle for his giving when he immigrated to America, to a place where winter endures for more than half the year. On a good day he tells people he’s from Zimbabwe instead, where he was born but not raised. The sun has failed to pierce through the thick grey outside, but he radiates enough light for the both of us when I ask him of home. I know today is a good day because he tells me about Zimbabwe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I learn, too, that he’s in a nursing program, at the university where I was once a graduate student. In a previous life, he was an electrical engineer who had wanted to work under one of my advisors, a professor of chaos and dynamical systems. His interest was complex systems and data science, just like mine was. But he had a family to raise, and it would be easier to do so as nurse in this country. So that’s what he chose. He gave up his dream to support his two children and his wife’s. His wife was already on track to earn her own PhD. At least there will be one doctor in the family, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What he misses most about Africa is the sense of community, his social life, the ability to walk down the street to meet a friend for coffee at any hour of the clock, people talking to each other, children running around everywhere with unscheduled freedom. It’s different in America. He feels more isolated, less connected. Everyone is friendly but no one wants to become friends. Who wants to transform their brief interactions at the gym and grocery store into deeper relationships, into invitations to linger on the couch, around the dinner table? His eyes dart to the grimy corner of the sauna. The smile has faded from his face.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My children&lt;/em&gt;, he says, &lt;em&gt;they’re so excited for summer&lt;/em&gt;. Why, I ask? &lt;em&gt;They’re excited to see their friends&lt;/em&gt;. They’re excited to go back home. There it is again: his smile. Eyes with home in sight. The warmth of a thousand suns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Making friends</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/24-02-01-making-friends/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/24-02-01-making-friends/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/NguyenHPhil/status/1746562063932010666&#34;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; of mine blew up recently. The last time something like this happened was over seven years ago, in response to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://qr.ae/pKzEjd&#34;&gt;Quora&lt;/a&gt; question I answered. It was super fun reading through the comments and retweets! (My favorites: “&lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/jumbleofjumbles/status/1746741449104986145?s=20&#34;&gt;men being wholesome is hot&lt;/a&gt;” and how this guy &lt;a href=&#34;https://x.com/RayyanIslam1/status/1746769299149107331?s=20&#34;&gt;met his wife&lt;/a&gt;.) Someone DM’d me later asking for advice on how to approach strangers in general, with the hope of becoming friends. I kind of feel silly writing about this because what I’ll say is so simple and obvious to me (just talk to people and see what happens!—I know I know, not always easy), but that’s what I’ll elaborate on in this post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe288ac5e-9007-40a4-8629-1bc347ec421f_1200x1720.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I should start by saying that the perfect recipe for making friends doesn’t exist. You can go through all the prescribed motions of Friend-Finding correctly and still fail to develop the relationships you were hoping for. This is partly because it’s easier to meet people than it is to cultivate fulfilling relationships. Dating apps and social media caters to the former, while the latter requires more effort, courage, and a genuine interest in others. It’s also an art, one that is learned through practice and consistent social exposure. Coffee shops are a great, low-stakes place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coffee shops are home to people who feel comfortable enough to present themselves in public. This means that they are at least open to the possibility of a fleeting, informal connection—otherwise they would just stay at home. Yes, you’ll encounter the occasional person who wants to be left to their own devices. But everyone else is out and about because they enjoy the energy and social atmosphere of frequented coffee shops. This presents as an opportunity to connect with people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If all of this is new to you, I would suggest becoming a regular at a coffee shop you like. It breeds familiarity with the space, which makes you feel more at home, but also with the baristas. They are your first point of contact every time you visit. You will interact with them the most. So get to know them! Establish rapport, give them a compliment here and there, banter a bit! It’s often the best and most interesting part of their job, getting to know people and listening to their various stories and anecdotes. Share and exchange some with them!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, regulars tend to befriend other regulars. They’ve been around each other enough that the odds of connecting are higher. It can be pleasurable just to see these people, and that may be all the fodder necessary to develop into something more, if it’s desired. These relationships may not become anything deeper, but they are crucial for creating a sense of community. In a sense then, they are very deep. They are foundational to your well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So now you’re a regular. The baristas know your usual order and the other regulars know you by name. There is the occasional joke on your behalf, which you gladly accept because what better sign is there of comfort and friendship? This is great, and you can leave things as they are. But then a cute, intriguing stranger waltzes in, orders a double-shot of single-sourced espresso, and sits by your favorite spot. They pull out a book you’ve been meaning to read and dive into it right away. What’s your move?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, this is the easiest of stranger scenarios to work with. This is because there are many possible points to connect on. You can comment on their book; you can compliment their outfit; you can ask them about their choice of coffee. When I met the aforementioned friend at the beginning of this post, he was reading Satre’s Existentialism is a Humanism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m not normally a reader of philosophy, but I tend to like the kind of people who are. So I asked him about the book and his interest in existentialism. This eventually led to an exchange of numbers. (Critical: you have to quickly follow-up with people who are potential friends.) The weekend after we went to another coffee shop and played together as wannabe intellectuals. The rest is history. Luck was certainly involved in the formation of our friendship, but this goes back to the benefits of being a regular. Simply by showing up consistently, you increase the likelihood of running into people who can become your close friends. Courage takes you the rest of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People tend to present with less points to connect on than discussed in the scenario above, or they’re not at all obvious. Hence, the power of small talk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fulfilling relationships are a function of “vibing well together, across a wider range of frequencies, over time.” What I mean is, if a friend is someone with whom you have &lt;a href=&#34;https://tasshin.com/blog/the-practice-of-friendship/&#34;&gt;shared context and understanding&lt;/a&gt; with, then the most satisfying friendships tend to exist between people who resonate along multiple dimensions of their being. Their wholeness has been brought into view and is continually magnified by the other. This is a sign that the relationship is growing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Small talk, then, is one way of detecting someone’s vibe. It helps you find and explore the potential frequencies along which you and another person may resonate on. Some degree of social skill and awareness is necessary to build up to true resonance, but usually it’s obvious when two people are vibing. The conversation flows smoothly; there is an abundance of banter and smiles, lightheartedness and laughter, comfort and touch in some cases; a kind of radiance emerges, as if two stars have momentarily become one. You don’t have to resonate intensely or immediately to become good friends with someone. But the possibility should be there, alongside the desire from all parties to become something more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My particular friendship was based on a narrow interest in ideas. Now, a year later, we still play the same game, but the field has grown. There is room for both academic seriousness as well as boyish shenanigans. More often than not I feel that we are simply shooting the shit, and that is a good thing. I’m more relaxed and compassionate as a result, something that would never have emerged if our friendship remained rooted in something purely intellectual. We still get coffee every weekend. This could be you, truly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>On categories and categorization</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/23-12-31-categories/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/23-12-31-categories/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F23fe13b6-1a22-484c-ac83-85c06c6e58b6_4028x2496.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently learned about the enneagram and found it to be useful in generating personal insight. (In case you’re curious I identify most with type four.) It gave me more language and a framework for describing behavioral and emotional patterns I’ve long noticed about myself. Pathways for growth were also described, not as answers to all of my problems, but as suggestions and possibilities that would make my life more pleasant if reasonably put into practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mentioned all of this to a friend and asked her to identify her type for fun. (I’ve asked several of my friends to do the same since identifying my own.) Afterwards she raised some questions I’ve been pondering. Aren’t these personality tests too reductionistic? How can we pin down all of human behavior into X distinct categories without losing something in the process?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m aware of the dangers of any classification system. They can do (and have done) real harm at both the individual and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/57693494&#34;&gt;collective&lt;/a&gt; level; they become stifling straitjackets when misapplied and abused. But that doesn’t mean we should dismiss them entirely. Pursuits like philosophy and science are inherently reductionist—even when you’re a die-hard phenomenologist or a practitioner of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Complexity&#34;&gt;complexity&lt;/a&gt; theory—yet they have led to the development of many things that have benefited us. This is because understanding itself is a form and act of compression wherein the richness of experience can be made comprehensible. In turn we are able to generate common points of discussion, fruitful conversation, and collective knowledge (and misunderstanding!).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong: I’m all for being raw-dogged by existence. Hence, in part, why I meditate! Hence, in part, why I have an annoying tendency to argue about terms and definitions, to ask for clarity when people talk as if everything were “obvious.” But to disregard typology and categories completely is to forget that they are useful because they simplify the world. Whether these simplifications are valid and useful in a given context is important to consider, especially when applied at scale. All rigid systems falter when individual variability is an important feature of the system, as is the case with humans. On a personal basis though, the measure of a personality test is probably better judged with regard to your specific circumstances. If identifying as a type four helps you live a better life, this is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sure, the devil lies in the details. Viewing yourself only as a depressed person or an enneagram type four can lead to trouble, and we certainly have a tendency of doing so. The nuances of our everyday challenges and complexities will always exist and confound the predictions of any typography. One needs discernment and a certain degree of a priori self-knowledge to make the most of these classifications. An awareness of the context for which they were developed helps too. At best the enneagram functions as a mythological vehicle that highlights truths about ourselves. It’s not a device for fact-finding, nor was it meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, the same can be said of much of what constitutes modern psychology. Plug a given person’s attributes into a psychological model and you’ll find that it isn’t that great at predicting individual outcomes. Even the championed five-factor model of personality (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Big_Five_personality_traits&#34;&gt;OCEAN&lt;/a&gt;) fails at making accurate predictions at the level of the individual, which is ultimately what matters to you. They just weren’t designed to do that well. The benefit of something like the enneagram is that you have more to work with in terms of descriptors. It’s much easier to map who you are and your struggles onto what are essentially storied archetypes of thought, emotion, and behavior than it is to do the same based on loose theories and statistical models. Academic psychologists have to come up with explanations anyways about why particular traits (which they also have to define) correlate with different outcomes at the population level. In the end we are all storytellers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We should be vigilant when attempting to understand ourselves and the world in too neat a fashion. I’m especially wary of typologies that classify people based on essentialist principles, i.e. as unchanging, immovable entities, which includes the enneagram. We are pattern-seeking, pattern-making beings who constantly dance and contend with the inseparability of form and emptiness, to frame it like a Buddhist. Put another way, we are not really fixed. We do present and discover patterns. Patterns remain endlessly abound within and all around us. To type and categorize them is to be wholly human. The enneagram is useful in that it provides richer food for thought than other typing systems when used as a tool for reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F688629c0-d149-4b67-bc09-ef745701c95a_4032x3024.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since my undergrad days (over a decade ago!), I’ve lived far away from the place of my upbringing. I’m reminded of how unusual this is every year when I visit for the holidays. Most of my family—including my extended family—live within an hour’s drive of each other. Meanwhile I’m situated across the country in Vermont, a state that’s quite sparse in terms of Vietnamese people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This puts me at a distance from them, though I can’t say we were ever really close, even when I was physically present in my youth. Often there was drama of some kind that I escaped through reading, friends, and video games. Only later, after I had moved out and individuated on my own, did I realize that I wasn’t alone in my struggle to connect on a deeper emotional level with my family.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My parents are lovely people. But they don’t get along with each other. They avoid each other when duty doesn’t call, and when it does they put up their shields of tolerance to fulfill the task at hand. Often times their shields crack and out come the jabs and criticisms they direct at each other (and my siblings and I). It’s been like this for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My sister was always aware of the distance and conflicts between them while I was usually occupied by a pixelated or imaginative landscape. But we both bore the consequences of their ongoing tension, of their inability to repair the ruptures. Each have their own personal challenges, too, that make it difficult for me to imagine something better between them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This seems to be a common experience among many first-generation Asian Americans, unfortunately. Vietnamese people in particular are a tough, resilient people. It’s built into their history and culture. But this also makes them incredibly fucking stubborn at times, leaving little room for grace and the possibility of intimate connection and understanding. There are certainly moments when the walls come down, e.g. my parents will manage to hug each other on Christmas morning. But left to their own devices and they will grit their teeth till nothing remains but flesh and bone dust.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My grandparents were unable to attend the Christmas gathering this year. They never missed one before, but my grandmother’s health has been deteriorating, and my grandfather takes care of her in response. He usually does the annual prayer that everyone glazes over, so that too was missing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It felt strange. Their absence put me in a deeply existential mood, one that made the moment more poignant and delicate. The festivities went on as usual, and I wondered if I was the only person who felt this way. What seemed more likely was that the family had grown used to the circumstances. They each took turns caring for my grandparents, and therefore were already familiar with their increasing lack of presence. Loss, too, is baked into Vietnamese blood. But are we ever truly ready for it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a way we prepare for it all our lives. Through the witnessing of seasons, in the tales and stories we tell, as we transition from one moment to the next. My cousins, nieces, and nephews will always be younger than me, but many of them are no longer little. They all stand out a little more in their personalities, in their intelligences and ways of being, in their unadulterated laughs. If there is hope for the older generation, it exists in the children and the cultivation of their latent sense of possibility. I wish I had enjoyed their company more when I was a child, but it’s never too late to change. Such is the substrate of life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes all it takes is a little bit of distance to realize this. In it I recognize more clearly the limitations of seeing my parents only as parents. They are humans, too, in all their quirks and shortcomings, in all the ways they continue to try their best despite (and because of) the hand they were dealt. It’s their otherness that fuels my appreciation and ignites my compassion for them. It’s the distance that makes coming home meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Looking ahead</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Allow yourself to drop everything just to see who you become.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd311544c-709c-4f84-8c16-680b6687e3ea_4032x3024.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is, at first, a period of disorientation. Who you thought you were isn’t as obvious as it always seemed. Certain pursuits fade away while others come forth like a puppy or child in need of play. Playlists get reworked, patterns are re-examined with the scrutiny of a philosopher. You’ve finally allowed time and your words to go on a smoke break so that meaning can breathe and be transformed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then, perhaps, your life will change. Slowly and imperceptibly. And then all at once. Not out of your own accord because you don’t know who you are anymore. But you never really did—you wouldn’t have tried otherwise. And yet look at where you are now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I remember finishing a blog post I was working on three months ago. I had published it in the evening and was on a walk when it occurred to me that something felt missing. I was content with what I’d written, but I felt no better about my life than I had prior to starting the piece.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Grief still ran through me erratically like lightning, highlighting the hallows that my recent heartbreak had rendered within. Per usual, I tried to play God and expedite the healing of my strife through the exposition of my soul. But I realized that no amount of words could ever garner the acceptance and compassion I desperately needed to give myself. They were never equipped to penetrate the walls of shame that towered over me like the cathedrals of false gods. Only love can do that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The love was always there. I just had to get up from the pews and welcome others in to witness, touch, and hold my hurting soul. I had to stop trying to prove that I was good enough to receive it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking a lot about moving to New York City. All signs point there when I ask myself where I want to explore living for the next few years. Happily my motivations are less about running from something (unlike before) than they are about the pursuit of real desire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, what’s keeping me afloat are my relationships. People I sometimes struggle to relate with continue to teach me the meaning of rupture and repair and what is capable of being built through consistency and commitment. Work ebbs and flows in its appeal and interestingness, but I find myself more grounded than not in the idea of holding down a “regular” job. There is even the wish to be productive, to contribute to the world in more meaningful ways.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coding is fun again, and I’ve signed up to volunteer on a “listening line” in order to appease the humanist in me. I’m writing less, I think, but am no less happier for having explored the horizons beyond my page. In fact, I’m certainly better off than I have been over the past few months through being busier. Maybe I really have matured and grown. I hope to continue doing so in 2024, whatever it may bring. It’s gonna be a year full of love and adventure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Past Lives</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/23-12-01-past-lives/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/23-12-01-past-lives/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://a24films.com/films/past-lives&#34;&gt;Past Lives&lt;/a&gt;, we follow childhood sweethearts Hae Sung and Nora Moon (previously Na Young) from South Korea to New York City, where they contend with notions of immigration and identity, choice and consequence, destiny and fated love. It’s a beautiful film, one that transcends your traditional romantic drama in a very satisfying way. I’m not a movie buff by any means, but it ranks among one of my favorite movies of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0377a41c-fc59-4a5d-b134-2c961cc82fa2_1350x870.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34; The New Yorker &#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, when the movie was over, I began to think about soulmates—the romantic kind, of course. The ones who always end up together in the end, despite the odds. It’s how things had to be, according to the scripture of Hollywood. Past Lives expands on this via the concept of &lt;em&gt;in-yun&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s an in-yun if two strangers even walk past each other in the street and their clothes accidentally brush, because it means there must have been something between them in their past lives. If two people get married, they say it’s because there have been 8,000 layers of in-yun over 8,000 lifetimes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In-yun is less about a predetermined outcome than it is about the forces that conspire to make a life possible, specifically when it comes to relationships. Whether as strangers or lovers, it connects us beyond time and death, ties us to the ballast of a shared narrative woven by the tiny encounters that punctuate our days. That hello with your local barista, that unacknowledged moment of quiet delight with someone you don’t (yet) know on the subway—under the spell of in-yun, chance has the opportunity to take on meaning, to become a lasting serendipity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Seven years ago, I won a trip to New York City to have breakfast with Stephen Dubner of Freakonomics. I learned of this the same day I had submitted my two-week notice for my first job out of college. An American Express card loaded with two thousand dollars was attached to the letter. Bring a friend, it said. I brought two.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was a trip of many firsts. First time on a plane as an adult. First time staying in an AirBnB. First time dancing in a gay bar. First time being offered a drink in a non-gay bar. First time ever seeing snow as it fell through the neon glare of Times Square. First time in NYC. It felt like something out of a movie, and I was living it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the last day, after my friends had departed, I went to the library near Bryant Park. A cute girl was sitting at one of the tables. Her red peacoat and black beret indicated to me that she was an artsy city person, the kind that SoCal, sun-bummed me would have never had the guts to approach. I was feeling bold that day though. There was magic in the air. Naively, I asked her, a total stranger, if she could watch my luggage. I wanted to buy a souvenir in the gift shop, I said, without the hassle of carrying my things around. She said yes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I ran inside and walked around the gift shop, pretending to browse as my mind began to reel. What’s the next move? What should I say when I return? Oh fuck—what if she runs away with all my shit? You naive Californian! This is the city! The City! I bought a self-help book and hurried out. Thankfully she was still there, and so was my luggage. She smiled at me, settling my panicked mood, and asked if I found what I was looking for. I smiled back, with the shy, impish grin of a child, and said yes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We talked for some time, and when I learned that she was leaving for home in a few hours, I asked if she wanted to explore the city with me. She said yes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First time exploring an unknown city with someone I had just met.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back in California, I knew I had to go back. One day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once, a lowly grad student was struggling to understand Karl Friston’s Free Energy Principle at a coffee shop in Vermont, when an unknown woman walked through the door. All the seats were taken except for the one beside him. Behind her mask, she asked if she could take the seat—and sit six feet apart, of course. Behind his mask, he said yes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The woman had recently been on a few bad dates and was ready to be single for awhile. She had plans with her friends that morning, but at the very last minute they were cancelled. She didn’t know what to do with the rest of her day, so she decided to go to a coffee shop, with Neil Postman’s Amusing Ourselves to Death in hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Immediately the tension was palpable. He ignored it and threw himself back into his equations as she wondered behind the red cover her book: how to start a conversation with him? Some time later, the boy rushed off to relieve himself in the bathroom. She decided then: I’ll ask him for a pen when he returns. He came back, and a pen was borrowed. They talked. They talked and got deep, wanting to see who was really behind the mask. The pen was returned afterwards, but not without a phone number in his hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fate implicates story, and stories are powerful, for better and worse. You know the Didion quote. I get tangled up in mine all the time. I romanticize, dramatize, idealize the people and events in my life, which sometimes leads to disappointment. Other times I’m brought to my knees out of sheer awe for the mental motions my mind is capable of. Sometimes they’re all we have to buoy ourselves against the existential tide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The struggle—my struggle—is remaining in touch with reality. It’s recognizing that I am more than the recursive, fleeting impressions of my sequestered landscape, the likes of which are often storied into existence, conforming it to my narrow, patterned ways. Ultimately I am better served in contact and connection with something Other, to others and principles and cheap canvases, where my imagination has a chance to become something more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we need to witness first-hand the ending of certain stories in order to realize that this is all they were: something beautiful, something tragic, something wholly human. We are more than the stories we tell ourselves, as their endings like to remind us. The endings are the beginnings are the endings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The boy was heartbroken. He had been heartbroken before, but not like this. His entire world had fallen apart. The image he had of himself as a descent, loving man no longer made sense, had been completely shattered. He had never broken someone else’s heart before, her heart, and felt he had done so clumsily. The worst of his pain came from the possibility that she would never recover from his actions. He blamed himself constantly and was convinced that he would never love and find love again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How could he? Guilt consumed him. Sin devoured his soul. His shame tormented him day and night, much like the hardened theories of a compromised Raskolnikov.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And yet. In time, with much discipline and inner work, held up by the arms of his generous friends—many alive, some dead—he found a way through his self-pity and constant abnegation of his self. Perhaps fate had deemed he was ready. In-yun decreed that there were other stories to be read and written.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He began to wonder—what’s still here for me? what do I want to do now?—and turned his gaze toward the future. Would he chase his ghosts like the haunted Hae Sung, only to find that he was more like Nora Moon? That the two were never so distinct, always one, their stories and being as necessarily entwined?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the first time in his life, he has nowhere he needs to be. He is not obligated to any job or person or city, despite the desire for stronger commitments. Where will he go? Hazily reflected in his eyes is a city. Nourishing communities. Trials and tribulations. Possibility waiting to be shaped into something new, something his, something beyond the stories he tells himself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>A Morning Walk</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/23-11-24-morning-walk/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/23-11-24-morning-walk/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f6a1a99-c4b8-410c-9c4d-fc4e80a7e001.heic&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I step out into the quiet hush of a gray-blue morning. Sun rays are peeking over a distant cloud, the sky is not yet fully awake. Snow is falling slowly, lightly, as if someone has gently flicked the snowglobe of the city with wool-covered fingertips. All the benches and tables I cross are covered and empty. The dead remain asleep while everyone else is hungover or stuck in a gluttonous stupor. There isn’t a single crumb on the ground for the taking. Still, the birds are up and singing. A squirrel is hiding his finds beneath a pile of leaves. The crows above are twirling like cloud dancers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I walk and catch myself bending my turns around corners, so I can linger a little bit longer. The cold invigorates me, refreshes me, reminds me that I’m alive, that there are forces in my body constantly fighting an inevitable end. A thought crosses me: it’s a matter of perspective. From stars to neurons, from neurons to silt. Transformations all around us. Everything everywhere all at once. Not far from me, someone is throwing seeds onto the ground. &lt;em&gt;Will the wrens find them before they bud?&lt;/em&gt; I walk by and hold her &lt;em&gt;good morning&lt;/em&gt; in my chest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The colorful apartments I pass are more beautiful against the gray. &lt;em&gt;What will I miss most when I leave this place?&lt;/em&gt; Elsewhere someone is surely walking around the lake. An image of You floats through awareness. We’re walking, admiring the naked crowns of trees, the soft colors of the landscape. I envelop myself within it like a child in need of a blanket. A line from Past Lives reaches me: &lt;em&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s true that if you leave you lose things, but you also gain things, too.&lt;/em&gt; I walk back to my apartment. The sky is glistening. &lt;em&gt;You dream in a language I can’t understand. It’s like there’s this whole place inside of you I can’t go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Thanksgiving</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/23-11-22-thanksgiving/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/23-11-22-thanksgiving/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffda1112e-8996-4f87-a6ff-ae448771192d_3024x4032.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanksgiving has always been a holiday of gluttony for me. My parents never noted its historic significance to my siblings and I when we were growing up, though my extra satisfied belly knew it was a special time. We celebrated in our own particular way—that is, with superior Vietnamese verve, flair, and dishes. We ate turkey and potatoes (roasted not mashed, of course), yes, but also sesame balls and egg rolls, bánh xèo and my dad’s infamous phở. This was normal for me growing up, the exceptional food and large parties my parents threw, the adults glazing over while my grandfather recited his annual prayer, the ten thousand kids screaming and running around everywhere like Chinese firecrackers. I didn’t—and probably couldn’t—appreciate all of this until I had moved across the country to live on my own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is where I’ve derived my love of cooking from. I’m not the best chef (though others do like what I make, thankfully!), but I enjoy hosting and making people feel at home, especially when it involves serving them a warm meal. Sadly my Thanksgiving plans fell through this year, meaning that I will be dining alone. I had the opportunity to go to Philadelphia with my roommate (“You’re pretty much part of the family at this point”), but decided to stay in Vermont instead to gather myself after my back to back weekend trips to SF and DC. I’m glad I did, though the closed shops and empty parking lots, the lack of undergraduates prancing to and fro, the unerring wintery quiet of the birdsongless streets—all of it has me feeling a particular loneliness this year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness is something I’m intimate with. It has colored a large number of my days as an adult, and I’ve really had to learn how to make space for it, how to befriend and utilize it in a generative fashion. Some say that it results from a lack of basic human recognition. That is, we feel lonely when our intrinsic humanity—that we exist and matter in the most broad sense—is left unacknowledged. I’ve certainly experienced this flavor of loneliness before, but what I currently feel is something more specific. Part of it has to do with the fact that I feel like I have no one to turn to in my immediate vicinity at the moment. Those who I normally lean on are either sick or traveling. I have group chats and friends online who I can talk with (which I have and am doing!), but it just isn’t the same as having a person physically near you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing is that I’m coming down from the connective high that characterized my recent weekend in DC. It simply felt amazing to spend a few days with a group of curious, emotionally attuned people under one rooftop. We hiked together. We sat in silence and cooked for each other. We walked and talked and walked and talked and walked and talked endlessly. There were certainly moments when I had to retreat to my room to catch a breath, but I knew that my friends were always on the other side of the door. It was exhausting in the best way possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One night we watched a movie (About Time) that brought up a lot of relationship grief for me. I cried in bed and didn’t sleep well that night, especially after also seeing on Instagram that my ex had been on a recent date (I know, I know, rookie mistake on my part for even looking—it was a premonition though, I honestly had a weird feeling that she had posted something, which was confirmed). In the morning, I talked about my pain with the woman who was hosting us, my friend who has lived many, many lifetimes. She listened and asked questions and shared relevant stories without offering any remedy to my grief, which was a huge source of relief and consolation. This encouraged me to open up more and more until there was nothing left but minor heartache and sleep deprivation. It’s rare that I get to do this, to share so openly and full of pain without feeling like a burden to someone who genuinely wanted to hold space. Waves of grief punctuated the rest of my day, but I felt that I could surf them more easily, in no small part thanks to the loving presence of my friends.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard, then, to come back from an experience like this. To a state that I love but have outgrown. It no longer feels like home. Visiting SF and DC has confirmed that my needs, desires, and ambitions have changed. I want to surround myself with more chaos and excitement than the green mountain state has to offer, as lovely and peaceful as it is. I want to be in a place with more people who match my vibe and interests, who can meet me where I’m at emotionally, intellectually, spiritually.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Related to these developments is the loneliness I feel. It’s the loneliness of an unsettled spirit. The spirit wants to be seen in all of its particular particularities, in all of its specific struggles, not as a static entity, not like the rest, but as a dynamic being subject to constant evolution. He wants to tell someone that he’s in one of the many minor key movements in the composition of his life—and that such musical dichotomies between major and minor keys, as suggested by his well-intentioned therapist, are in fact really dumb and unfaithful to life’s nuances, but are also in truth so relatable and so resonant. He wants someone to &lt;em&gt;get it&lt;/em&gt;, to understand where he’s at and who he is in this period, not in a general sense, but in a fully embodied &lt;em&gt;I’m staring into your eyes and I see mud, lots of it, and it’s pretty gnarly, but I’m here for it, for all the edges and razors that you will develop in carving out a path that is truly yours.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There will be no turkey this Thanksgiving. There will be no mashed potatoes. But dal soup is on the menu, as are brussel sprouts. And for that the spirit is grateful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>A trip to SF</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/23-11-17-sf/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/23-11-17-sf/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc82079e8-fdeb-4a68-8075-6b49099d2e04_4032x3024.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently attended a two-day meditation retreat with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.evolvingground.org/&#34;&gt;Evolving Ground&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.evolvingground.org/sf-retreat&#34;&gt;SF Commons&lt;/a&gt;. I’d worked with Charlie and Jared (the teachers) before in a Vajrayana-based online workshop, but I wasn’t sure what to expect in a formal, in-person retreat setting. I was also afraid that my lower back issues would flare up and prevent me from going deep during sits, and I hardly slept the night of my arrival.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the trip was an incredibly rich experience. It was both joyful and challenging—and so much more. There were moments when I was literally sweating on a cushion with others, and I wanted nothing more than to go deeper into practice. I wanted to continue exploring and playing alongside my fellow seekers, many of whom I felt an unfamiliar sense of kindredness with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the retreat was “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.evolvingground.org/opening-awareness&#34;&gt;opening awareness&lt;/a&gt;” meditation. It’s a kind of meditation that stands contra to the more renunciative, focus-based practices that have become popular in the West. Rather than honing your ability to focus your attention on say, the breath, opening awareness is about allowing for everything to arise—thoughts, feelings, sights, sounds, bodily sensations, etc—while &lt;em&gt;remaining uninvolved&lt;/em&gt; with said things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(The language here is frustratingly subtle but important. Bear with me because what follows is going to be vague and verbose. As with many things meditation, it’s easier to understand in practice than in esoterica.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Remaining uninvolved” does not mean to actively change the context of experience, to return to your anchor (e.g. the breath) when something like a thought or sensation arises in your field of awareness. Rather, it’s about allowing the openness and spaciousness that already characterizes awareness to emerge &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt; whatever arises is arising, &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt; whatever happens is happening. It’s a recognition, a &lt;em&gt;letting things be&lt;/em&gt; rather than a letting go, a noticing of both the clouds and the vastness of the sky &lt;em&gt;all at once&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me get concrete. Sometimes, when I walk around my neighborhood, I get lost in thought. A thought will occur to me as if from nowhere, and then, before long, it becomes an all-consuming story, one that isn’t even lively or clear—yet it warps and distorts the entirety of what I’m experiencing. Experience itself is thus rendered as something hazy and narrow in its texture. I feel like a zombie sleepwalking through the world in this state, totally unaware—or only aware—of the grainy, low-resolution movie at play. The world, as far as experience is concerned, is this story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Snapping out of it is like leaving my heated apartment on a wintery night in Vermont. I instantly become aware of the fact that I was lost in thought as the world returns to clarity and openness. Experience now feels less crowded because my thoughts can be situated within awareness as one of many “things” that I can choose to engage with or not. Everything else in the immediate moment (including the act of thinking, which is different from having thoughts) suddenly feels more meaty, connective, visceral.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spacious presence&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;spacious involvement&lt;/em&gt; are the outcomes of opening awareness. I practice so that it’s easier to allow for a vaster sense of awareness to accompany my days. This, in turn, generates the capacity to respond freely to one’s situation rather than from patterned thought, feeling, and behavior. The result is a richer, more vivid experiencing of life. With practice one naturally develops power, clarity, playfulness, and autonomy as well as compassion, social effectiveness, inner security, and creative spontaneity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The path is highly experimental and individualized. What you become aware of and how you practice with what arises depends on your intentions, your goals, your personal psychology, and so on, which can make it hard to know how one is progressing. But that’s the beauty of it too: it’s an exploratory practice that equips and enables you to be more you, to embody and embrace the possibility that there are other modes of being in the world, modes that you can play with and step into fully when circumstance calls.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People respond uniquely to being seen, especially when it involves the eyes. Eyes touch us, move us, charge us with vitality, temptation, desire. They fill us with their intensity, which makes us want to discharge intensely. What might it feel like to make space for all of this aliveness, this energy? To turn toward the gaze of another without releasing what arises?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is something we played with in retreat. My patterned response to being looked at was to smile. It felt automatic and varied depending on who it was, whether they were male or female, young or old, shorter or taller than me. It’s unsurprising that I smiled more indiscriminately and easily with women. This smile always felt friendly, light, inviting, open. With men my smile was more guarded, testy, as if I were sussing them out and sizing them up on various dimensions of masculinity. &lt;em&gt;Are you my brother or a threat? Where do I stand in relation to you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I sat across from R for the last exercise. We meditated and then were instructed to silently gaze at each other. In the first thirty seconds I felt apprehensive and judgmental, perhaps as a remnant of our brief conversation during lunch, and certainly due to previous conditioning. This shortly gave way to something more subtle, a delicate curiosity and appreciation of his being. We had practiced feeling the distinction between appreciating and liking someone the day before. They aren’t the same, though I noticed the more I appreciated him, the more fond of him I grew. His left eye twitched in a specific way. His irises were brown and darker than my own. His outward coolness was accompanied by warm and comforting vibrations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We were told to close our eyes after seven minutes or so. Immediately the connection we had built was severed. A quiet sadness bubbled inside my chest and then bloomed throughout my body like a virus. Tears swelled at the corner of my eyes, leaving me in the hallows of something familiar, an ancient loneliness I am well-acquainted with. Slowly awareness expanded around these feelings and sensations like a blanket. I felt secure in its presence. What followed was compassion and warmth. And when I was allowed to open my eyes, I was full of gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everyone has an aura, an atmosphere that, once you’re inside of it, shifts your state of being, sometimes subtly, sometimes abruptly. Mine was unassuming, neutral, open, like vanilla, according to R. I was slightly offended by this (ha) of course. But he reported to the group that this allowed him to feel truly comfortable in my presence, a feeling he had more trouble finding with others. This feeling had also transformed into something warm and light by the end of our sit, like a bright cup of tea that perfectly complements the shadows of our souls.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Only later did I learn that &lt;a href=&#34;https://slate.com/human-interest/2005/08/how-vanilla-became-shorthand-for-bland.html&#34;&gt;vanilla&lt;/a&gt; is quite complex. And in many ways, it makes the world go ‘round.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the retreat, despite being sleep-deprived, I bumbled through the streets of San Francisco with a renewed sense of lightness. Certain thoughts and emotions I had suffered from months ago felt like they could now be physically located and situated within a spacious container—that of awareness—which left room for things like joy and wonder to arise on their own. This seems the natural outcome of finding stability and security in what was already there. The more I recognize this, the easier it is to be courageous as I consider big life changes like a move by summer, potential romances and relationships, projects I want to commit to, difficult conversations I need to have.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, I met up with an online friend I hadn’t met yet and had a nice time with her and her husband. I played their guitar, ate Chinese food, walked around, and chatted with strangers and yet-to-be friends. The more I explored the more I thought of my ex. So much of SF and the Bay was in her; so much of her was in the city. How strange and wonderful and sad it is, I thought, that this is where I’m at. I cried and shouted and laughed to myself as rollerskaters cruised by in the night. I messaged a friend and drank milk tea in Chinatown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you knew that awareness was always there for you, what would change? How would you live differently? It stands here, not like the distant, godly &lt;a href=&#34;https://poets.org/poem/archaic-torso-apollo&#34;&gt;torso of Apollo&lt;/a&gt;, but by your side as a constant companion who will be with you in the trenches of life, one who, like a good friend, recognizes and accepts your differences while encouraging you that so much more is possible than you realize.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>The need for aliveness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6268f231-8037-4929-9dd6-4c348fae966d_4032x3024.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was talking to a friend about ADHD recently, and it reminded me of an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hunterinafarmersworld.com/p/what-maslow-overlooked-the-need-to?twclid=21iwzg7u0vxercg7ilbb47odax&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on the basic need to feel alive. The core idea is that each of us has different set-points, thresholds beyond which life begins to feel colorful, vivid, satisfying. These thresholds are a function of our biological makeup, namely the thalamus and Reticular Activating System (RAS) in our brains. Together they mediate the sensory inputs we receive from the environment—much like how an equalizer controls different features of a song we’re listening to—ultimately shaping how we experience our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some people have more sensitive thalamus/RAS structures than others. Those on the lower end of the spectrum require less intense input to feel alert and alive. On the other hand you have your thrill-seekers and adrenaline junkies, those of us who need constant, highly stimulating activity to feel the same degree of aliveness. All of this has me wondering: is it possible to change our baseline, the boundary beyond which we can experience life as full?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I sit somewhere in the middle of the sensitivity spectrum. I enjoy slower, typically sadder music; I can lay on my couch in silence and daydream pleasantly for extended periods of time; I meditate—and actually find it enjoyable (and &lt;a href=&#34;https://philintheblank.substack.com/p/a-dark-night&#34;&gt;terrifying&lt;/a&gt;). But this would surprise you if you knew me as a kid. I spent an inordinate amount of time playing video games, much to the chagrin of my parents. And not strategy or puzzle games mind you, but fast-paced, twitchy games like World of Warcraft, League of Legends, and Counter-Strike. School was always a drag for me—too boring, too slow. So were relationships that lacked emotional intensity and intimacy, for better and worse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was quite the unexpected shift then when I quit playing video games in my third year of college. Even more surprising is that I filled the ensuing void with what can seem like the total opposite: meditation. I didn’t know what I was getting into when I signed up for the 6-week research study that would teach me how to practice. What appealed to me was the idea that it could radically change my life in a short span of time, a thought that’s surely characteristic of those who hunger for intensity, ironically enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it’s possible that my baseline for aliveness hasn’t changed, only what makes me feel alive. I suspect this is part of the picture, though my gut tells me that I can’t dismiss the role of, for example, meditation and psychedelics. Our nervous systems and psychology shape and are shaped by experience in highly connected, multi-layered, spatiotemporal feedback loops. There are also accounts of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Stars-Our-Pockets-Getting-Sometimes/dp/080700264X&#34;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; who move through the world differently after having spent extended periods of time in solitude. Free from the frenetic pace of modernity, they tend to become more sensitive, more spiritual, more attuned to the subtler rhythms that pervade existence. This can be deeply unsettling for some as the scaffold of what they thought was true falls apart, especially their notion of themselves. Who are you now when what once held up your world is crumbling? When what used to fill your aliveness meter no longer does?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aging seems to be an important factor here. As I’ve gotten older, I find myself gravitating towards quieter activity—reading, writing, playing music, long walks by myself in nature, one-on-one conversation. The usual forms of socializing don’t satisfy me as much (though now that I think about it they never really have), nor do things like quick trips and short-term flings. What I want instead is the space to dwell and linger. I want to create beautiful things, things that may require a lifetime to build. To the hurried observer this process will almost always appear as boring, monotonous. They’re not necessarily wrong. But what they don’t notice is how I feel inside when I’m engaged in this way. What’s there is often a different story, one I constantly try to convey in &lt;a href=&#34;https://philintheblank.substack.com/p/after-the-party&#34;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is what has been haunting me recently. Maybe my basic aliveness needs aren’t being fulfilled by where I live, who I’m physically surrounded with, how I’m spending my time. As I tend to past wounds and continue to explore what brings me joy, I feel compelled to move somewhere new. There’s a yearning for more, for something different, for the kind of depth I can’t seem to cultivate given where I’m at, physically and mentally and emotionally. Fear naturally arises, but so does curiosity: where would I go? Brooklyn? Montréal? Portland? The Bay? And what exactly am I looking for? In many ways, more of the same. Adventures in stillness, stillnesses in adventure. Connection and intimacy. To love and be loved. To open my heart to and for the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>A dark night</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffdf4b271-da3d-45b6-8794-5442b359cda2_1024x1024.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last night I woke up around 3am and couldn’t fall back asleep. There was fear and sadness bubbling in the middle of my heart. Rather than turn away, I tended to it and looked at the feelings directly. And then I lost control of my body. Something had seized my mind and wouldn’t let go.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’d suffered from sleep paralysis before, but this was different. Unsure of how to respond, I surrendered to it and allowed my awareness to expand and wrap around what was happening. This was followed by a powerful tingling in my head and a penetrating terror that shook me to my bones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The wave ended not long after, thankfully. I then started to think about the phenomenon of emptiness, a fundamental concept and experience in Buddhist meditative practices. The idea, as I understand it, is that everything lacks an essence; it’s ephemeral, constantly shifting. Even emptiness itself is subject to emptiness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t sure if what had just happened was related to my recent meditations and readings about it, but it seemed to make things worse in the moment. A second wave of tingling and terror overcame me, and again, I let myself be taken. As with bad or challenging psychedelic trips, it’s not always easy to let go and swim with the currents. I sensed that I wanted to scream for help from my roommate just down the hall but I literally couldn’t if I tried. Eventually, again, things settled, before a third and final wave swept me up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I fell asleep shortly after the wave subsided and had a strange dream involving a close friend that was being evicted from a shared apartment. I woke up, dazed and oddly calm, and crawled to the couch in the living room. Before my roommate left for work, I asked for a tight hug. I wanted to squeeze harder but didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of me thinks this whole episode is linked to my meditation practice. I think I should stop, at least for a hot second, but I’m also curious about going deeper. Like, how is it that I experienced what I just experienced and still feel relatively calm and centered? How did I become so suddenly helpless by simply thinking about an idea and its implications? I want to keep meditating and find out what else is possible, and it’s not like I can stop &lt;a href=&#34;https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/should-you-meditate-and-also-what&#34;&gt;meditating&lt;/a&gt; even if I tried. It’s built into my fundamental experience of life at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But also, for one day, I’d like to feel more ordinary. This is, of course, always a possibility, always available to me and everyone else. The point of practice is to learn and truly see that it’s there, kind of like a &lt;a href=&#34;https://philintheblank.substack.com/p/on-social-performing&#34;&gt;mask&lt;/a&gt; you can put on and take off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Understanding as a practice</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/23-10-21-understanding-practice/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/23-10-21-understanding-practice/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F58b01c6e-1edd-40a0-925c-7011d7bd8cb3_4028x2519.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the intro of a statistics textbook I once read, the authors described understanding as a &lt;strong&gt;skill&lt;/strong&gt; that can be practiced:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Understanding concepts such as the ones taught in this course requires you to practice thinking. What that usually means is practicing making connections. For example, you need to take an idea you learn about in this course and practice thinking about how it applies to new situations, and how it connects with other related ideas. This is what you need to do to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is obvious, but the framing made something click for me. It suggested &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; one might go about learning difficult, abstract subjects like statistics. &lt;em&gt;Just think more!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, it can be hard to think (truly!), even when regarding things that are meaningful and &lt;a href=&#34;https://psyarxiv.com/2emk9&#34;&gt;pleasurable&lt;/a&gt; to us. The cognitive demand is high, and thinking can be stressful. Viewing it as a practice can help.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Throughout my years of schooling, I’d thought of understanding as something that either happened or didn’t in eureka moments, contrary to evidence in other areas of my life. (I guess I didn’t really think about it, ha.) So whenever I didn’t immediately grasp what I was studying, I abandoned my efforts and dismissed the subject entirely. In retrospect, I just didn’t want to go through the struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As with sports, the pursuit of understanding requires effort over time. This frees us from the impossibility of understanding something all at once, making the endeavor more self-sustaining and enjoyable. It becomes a journey, one that can reinvigorate what the modern world has worn away—our capacity for contemplation, our respect for stillness and the unknown, the ability to put things in perspective. These are necessary ingredients in the quest for deeper understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What’s also needed is time to rest and recover. It surprises me how easy it is to bounce from one activity to the next without pause; there’s always something I’m engaged in whether it’s reading, writing, or playing music. The trouble is that non-stop practice and activity increases the risk of injury and burnout whether we’re doing physical or mental gymnastics. Thinking is a passive-yet-alert kind of engagement that requires distance, the silence and space to dwell, in addition to the work itself. Carve out pockets of stillness, take a walk without your phone, let your mind freely roam in unassailed fashion—downtime is needed so that our attempts at conceptual connection have a chance to solidify.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That understanding demands time and effort may actually steer you away from certain pursuits. You might discover, for example, that you don’t care about philosophy or Russian literature as much as you thought you did. Maybe you just wanted to feel smart and scholarly—which is fine!—or you’d rather be doing something else after your initial exposure to a topic or subject.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may also discover and refine what you truly like (and dislike). I’m currently participating in a philosophy and classics discussion group. It’s clear that I don’t enjoy reading philosophy as much as I thought I would—which, again, is fine! I prefer Dostoevsky and Plato’s dialogues over, say, Aristotle’s Ethics; I’d rather meditate on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-That-Frees-Meditations-Emptiness-ebook/dp/B00SI7PQD8?crid=2U8WF1T84H1JL&amp;amp;keywords=seeing+that+frees&amp;amp;qid=1692618904&amp;amp;sprefix=seeing+tha,aps,98&amp;amp;sr=8-2&#34;&gt;emptiness&lt;/a&gt; than grapple in analytical futility at a definition of virtue. But I wouldn’t have known this unless I’d given the readings a concerted effort. They’ve also shown me that thinking can be fun, especially when done with others. This feels like enough to keep me coming back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Making relevant connections is key. If the connections are irrelevant or meaningless or nonsensical, what you may develop is a degree of familiarity with something, breadth over depth, but not understanding itself. A visual may be helpful: if our knowledge is a large graph comprised of numerous nodes and edges, then the edges would represent the connections between concepts and ideas, the nodes. The practice is thus attempting to connect as many relevant nodes as you can to each other. A highly connected chunk of the graph would then represent how much you understand something. In social contexts, this graph is developed communally. The result is sometimes a cathedral.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thinking often feels like waiting for something to pop into my mind. I’ll sit in the blank of the moment, waiting for something to emerge into awareness. If something does it becomes a pivot point in conversation, for example, with myself and others, assuming the goal is to understand something. This is different from the deliberate attempt to make connections between things. Hence why you fail to realize that you don’t understand something as much as you thought you did when you try to externalize it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having some kind of external output is important. It concretizes understanding as a practice. Writing is a clear example of this; some even say that writing is thinking. Additionally, when we externalize our practice, it becomes social. The benefit of this is that others can help you see where your understanding might be lacking. This facilitates learning and deepens your knowledge beyond what’s possible on your own. It’s also a basis upon which potentially fulfilling relationships can be formed. Nothing is quite like the beauty of witnessing a well-carved, passionate, spirited mind in motion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should be said that there are kinds of understanding that cannot be gained solely through thinking. I’m thinking—ha—about the distinction between &lt;em&gt;mētis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;epistēmē&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Mētis&lt;/em&gt; refers to a kind of understanding that is developed through practice in relation to some aim. It is necessarily tied to an aim and thus dynamically evolves as the aim changes in response to one’s context and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262545662/context-changes-everything/&#34;&gt;constraints&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I remember trying to help my dad de-fat a rack of ribs one Christmas dinner. I’d wanted to contribute more than my presence that year and to pick up some of my dad’s chef chops. The task, however, was beyond my reach. I moved too slowly, too inefficiently, too recklessly. Precious meat was lost with every cut. Eventually he took over and cleaned the entire rack with what looked like a single swing. He knew exactly where and how much to cut; he worked with the deftness of a seasoned artisan. It took him five minutes to do what would’ve taken me at least half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I understood why the fat needed to be stripped. I knew what needed to be done and how to do it. But my dad had the advantage of purpose and practice that made him effective in the kitchen. He had needed to cook for himself and his family almost daily from a young age. How he generally orients toward the world is more &lt;em&gt;mētis&lt;/em&gt; than &lt;em&gt;epistēmē&lt;/em&gt;. He’s the street-smarts guy you can rely on in a plumbing emergency while I’m over here fudging words about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Classical philosophy (from Plato onward) is very much &lt;em&gt;epistēmē&lt;/em&gt;. It’s developed in the world of ideals and forms. It’s abstracted and generalizable, which certainly has its place and uses. But you won’t understand how to de-fat a pig by thinking about it. You gotta get your hand on the knife and cut. Meditation, and even statistics, involves &lt;em&gt;mētis&lt;/em&gt;, the tacit form of understanding that you cannot gain without playing with your data or sitting on a cushion, working on real problems alongside other analysts and yogis. What &lt;em&gt;epistēmē&lt;/em&gt; lacks &lt;em&gt;mētis&lt;/em&gt; accounts for. &lt;em&gt;Epistēmē&lt;/em&gt; is definable, idealized, a dream. &lt;em&gt;Mētis&lt;/em&gt; is clutchness, vibe, moment-to-moment intuition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A final thought: what might it look like to understand a person? It’s not so much about what we know of them than it is about having a good sense of who they are. It’s knowing what they find funny as well as how, tacitly, to make them laugh should the opportunity arise. This requires practice, showing up again and again in the web of relation, with a stance that is more &lt;em&gt;mētis&lt;/em&gt; than &lt;em&gt;epistēmē&lt;/em&gt;. To see and know someone as an immovable ideal is, at best, only part of the picture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

They feel like they sometimes put on a mask when in social settings despite wanting to relate to others in a more genuine, less guarded way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve felt this way at times, though in a less overt manner. My tendency is to prune and filter what I feel and think to maintain social peace, to avoid rejection and the possibility of looking dumb. Even venting about my struggles to close friends can be difficult despite being welcomed to do so (this has hurt me before in the past). Hence, probably, my preference for listening and asking questions rather than expressing what’s actually on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But this means that no one ever gets to know me. They see the partial, curated bits, but rarely ever my desires, longings, and shadows, the rest of what makes me whole. Edges, flaws, everything else—to know someone is to see them clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Masks are helpful and useful; social performing is sometimes necessary. But when we grow too attached to them and the facade of what they provide, we miss out on the possibility of relating to ourselves and others with more depth. Depth often simply requires that we show up, be present, and allow for the moment to unfold as it wishes, over and over again. The stance is one of playful opportunism rather than forcefully willing oneself, others, and the situation to be something it is not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes people don’t want to relate other than through the world of masks, and that’s okay. It takes time for them to come off, if ever at all. What’s needed is the skill and awareness to see and meet people where they’re at, to recognize when our masks have become straitjackets rather than joyous, fluid props that enable us to come more alive in given moments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a blunder I’ve made on dates before. I’d want what I perceived to be a mask to come off when, really, I wanted the boundaries between the other and myself to dissolve. I’d want &lt;em&gt;immediate&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3nXYVlPrcY&#34;&gt;level three intimacy&lt;/a&gt; upon meeting someone because I chronically felt lonely and yearned for emotional closeness. I sought constant reassurance and longed to be held by someone at the end of the day. But it takes time to get there; there are good reasons for why people want to take things slow. One should respect and savor this process of truly getting to know someone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you do so, it’s worth getting to know who you really are, what it feels like to be you in your quieter moments, why there might be something getting in the way of showing that. Maybe you’re lonely and are afraid to admit it. Maybe you think that the way to get what you want is to be what you’re not. In any case, the best relationships are the ones in which we can show up fully and wholly, which involves embracing the perfect imperfections that have been given to us. This begins with the relationship you have with yourself. Having good friends certainly helps too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We hide because we are afraid or ashamed of something about ourselves. We fear the consequences of what might happen if people discover what actually brings us joy and makes us tick, who we are when we feel safe and grounded enough to trust the present. The goal is not to become fearless or shameless—these emotions serve us when properly calibrated. Rather, it’s recognizing that it’s already acceptable and lovely to be human, to be you. That can take a lot of work to feel in your bones, but it’s well worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Quiet and lingering</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe3b0c1d5-db1e-4927-872c-3a42ff8a8588_4032x3024.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m surprised by how often I need to retreat after socializing. It’s not that I don’t enjoy being social, nor do I consider myself an introvert. There are simply times when I’d rather be by myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Much of my joy these days occurs in private, quieter moments, at a distance from the crowd where I can respond to the world in an unhurried manner. It’s easier to linger and let my imagination roam this way—on a child’s gait and the way he move through space; on a beautiful woman’s voice and laugh; on the universes held within words that have been arranged like bouquets. People are universes too, but sometimes they crowd out other aspects of my conscious experience that I delight in. This too is an experience of its own, one I’m continuously learning how to make room for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some people move through life as if it were a giant buffet to be gorged on. They constantly bounce from one idea and happening and art piece to the next, never really going deeper on one single portion. It’s relatable, particularly when it comes to books and ideas. But I’ve noticed that I tend to circle back to the same threads over and over again—Buddhist being and practice; stories and writing; music and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I move slowly in learning and thought. I like to dwell and feel the passage of time. People who I feel comfortable in silence with are treasures. A universe like mine needs adequate space, a chance to chew. I come alive when I sense the presence of absence, when what’s happening is allowed to bloom like a flower before spring, when the roses are not merely sniffed like a TikTok reel, but fully received as a gift. There’s a desire for depth over breadth, a reassurance in the motions that emerge while sitting still.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The hours soften and steady themselves when I have the freedom to explore and create. This was true for me as a kid, and it remains so today. Like John Mayer in his formative years, I find and build temples around what feels sacred to me. I have my places to return to when the world gets too loud, refuges where I can worship the song in a single chord or poem. It’s here where I find again and again that this is enough. That magic and the sacred are real, that they’re in all of us and all around us. The work is seeing it, believing it, letting it live through us as it intends. This is why I write.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the quiet, on my own, it’s easier for me to find, nurture, and eventually, share.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

What’s emerging is slowness and resolution, emptiness and decay, the shedding of old skin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I look into the mirror and ask myself: who am I now? It’s fall. No more older than before by the look of things, much to the amusement of those who know me. It’ll hit me, I reassure them, this aging thing. One day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People around me are breaking up and breaking through, are shifting into becoming rather than being. The rest of us are snuggled beneath the certainty of weighted blankets, watching leaves surrender to their delicate nature. The ground serves them better this time of year while the sun reminds us that nothing is permanent and everything is brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s a truth that our eyes perfectly cup the sun. Your own are surrounded by wrinkles, roads that all lead me back to you. I want to walk them endlessly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m searching for a sign, reassurance maybe. But you tell me that there is nothing more than this. Between you and me, this is enough. Clouds covering the sky. The smell of dead leaves. A happy pup between our curious feet. Walk with me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you’re gone the past starts crowding in, patterns I’m familiar with now and the simultaneous impulse to retreat and reach. I lay instead, head-first into a pillow, and feel what I feel without explanation. I fall asleep and there she is, already an inhabitant of my dreams. I wake up and try not to forget, but some things don’t change.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Love languages and the end of love</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/23-08-30-love-lang/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/23-08-30-love-lang/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I read a &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Cooperstreaming/status/1694031965400482178&#34;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; recently lambasting the five love languages and their author. (You certainly know the &lt;a href=&#34;https://5lovelanguages.com/store/the-5-love-languages&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;.) Specifically, the tweeter wrote that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will NEVER stop talking about how &amp;ldquo;love languages&amp;rdquo; is just something made up by a misogynistic pastor, thoroughly unqualified to write a psychology self help book, so he could insist wives owed their husbands sex on demand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That’s all this trash has ever been.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like everyone else who has heard of the love languages, I haven’t actually read the book. I also have no stakes in the truth of these claims regarding their author, Gary Chapman. But I am interested in why an idea like the love languages has remained so popular throughout the course of its 30 year existence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of the answer seems to be that we, as humans, want to understand others and ourselves. We want to know how to be and act, and we dislike dealing with ambiguity and uncertainty. (Hence the appeal and popularity of self-help.) This is especially true when it comes to dating and relationships. Sociologist Eva Illouz writes about this eloquently, if not dryly at times, in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/End-Love-Sociology-Negative-Relations/dp/0190914637&#34;&gt;The End of Love&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Her book explores the connection between capitalism and the rise of the “negative relations.” Negative relations refer not to the quality of our relationships (though their quality is certainly implicated), but rather the way that they are formed and characterized in the modern age. Specifically, our relationships are increasingly defined by “non-choice,” by an unwillingness to choose a person or relationship to date or otherwise commit to, by a lack of definition and direction. If marriage was once the endgame of relationships (it still is for the majority of people), then negative relations describe the opposite: they are relationships centered on uncertainty and the lack of deeper relating.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Negative relations stem from the capitalization of the idealogical freedoms that feminists have historically fought for. Put another way, the freedom to love has manifested as another form of consumer choice. Consider how we sometimes talk about relationships: our speech is riddled with the impersonal, transactional vernacular of the market. The result is a dehumanization of the person, Illouz argues, which has produced: an abundance of ghosting, more flakiness, hurt feelings and the fear of intimacy, the romanticization of &lt;a href=&#34;https://haleynahman.substack.com/p/159-falling-in-love-is-overrated?publication_id=33628&amp;amp;post_id=136434827&amp;amp;isFreemail=false&#34;&gt;falling but not staying in love&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s great that we can be in relationship with a wider range of people from all walks of life. It’s wonderful that we can choose what to make of our relationships, free from the sometimes too narrow purview of religion and social norms. These are things we should celebrate as an achievement of modernity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But freedom without constraint tends to chaos, which is no freedom at all. What we need are better norms around dating and relating. What we need is to recognize the importance of values and moral development—without it devolving into another form of control over the masses. People are not fungible bodies on a swipeable rotisserie. There is an essence to us that deserves &lt;a href=&#34;https://time.com/6160096/rethinking-sex-christine-emba-review/&#34;&gt;dignity&lt;/a&gt; and respect, within all our romantic antics.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a86b6fc-dc45-46f3-b017-be29b482e1bf_838x617.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The desire for deep, genuine, committed connection still exists. We hunger for safety and closeness, for the kinds of inside jokes and wordless knowings that are forged only through the heat of what lasts. Our attraction to the love languages seems to reflect this yearning, in part. We want to express and receive love in ways that feel nurturing and connective, that builds us up and lead us somewhere, even when the relationship itself, whatever its trajectory, has run its course.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The love languages themselves are kind of silly, frankly; it’s obvious that they aren’t distinct categories of expression. Take acts of service for example, and physical touch. Physical touch can be received as an act of service. The same can be said of gifts and words of affirmation. I can also imagine a kind of high-quality quality time that involves the tongue of every language.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, they are appealing if only to highlight and reinforce the sentiment that people like to receive and express love in different ways. This is something we can all agree on as a net positive resulting from the book. The jokes and memes are fun too. (“My love language is nitpicking love languages!”) I like to believe that the tweeter above is frustrated because they, like Gary Chapman, believe in a better kind of love.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Inspiration &amp; memory</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/23-08-17-inspiration-memory/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/23-08-17-inspiration-memory/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2fc9762-fbf9-4584-a47c-c890ec1aff91_4032x3024.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was walking out of a coffee shop in Oregon the other day when a tiny brown napkin flew across my feet. What followed was a cascade of memories that brought me back to a particularly creative winter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was the first year of the covid pandemic (and grad school). I was holed up inside my apartment. The days were lonely at times, but also full of aliveness and energy. I sketched, read, wrote, played guitar, and walked around whenever the wind and snow had settled. &amp;ldquo;I could spend most of my days like this,&amp;rdquo; I said to my penpal. We talked about how easy it is to forget things, and then I suddenly remembered the first time I visited New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In particular I recalled walking the streets with a stranger I met on the last day of my trip. I had asked her to watch my luggage for me so that I could buy something from the Bryant Park library gift shop. There were other motives too, frankly: I thought she was attractive and had wanted to talk to her. So young, so bold, so naive—she could have ran with my things!—but we ended up enjoying the city together. We got coffee at a local shop, walked to and through Central Park, shared dreams and stories, and struggled to find a public bathroom, all within the span of three hours. The goodbye was short and sweet, just like her, just like the memory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’d always been a shy kid (imagine bookish, bespectacled, Asian gamer) who believed he was unattractive. So it was a big deal for me that the adventure had gone so well. The experience was incredibly formative. And then I forgot about it. When I’d tell people about the time I won a trip to NYC (through a Freakonomics raffle!), the story with the stranger was always omitted. That it had come back while talking to my penpal in the midst of winter, years later, generated some images in mind regarding the nature of memory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I pictured a kind of book, one with an infinite number of pages containing the full content of our lives. These books were physical, meaning they suffered too as bodies do when held by the hand of time. Ink rotted into dust, pages loosened and floated away with every flick of a page-turn. Retrieving memories was thus like chasing after ghosts and symbols that, when obtained and superimposed on one another, could constitute a life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Who was doing this busywork of encoding and retrieval? I imagined a ghostwriter inside each of us. They served as crucial members in the society of the self, and were also subject to time and processes physical. Mine was a forgetful old man with wobbly, boney hands. He spent his days in the dark rooms of my mind binding disparate pages together for future retellings. Sometimes the pages flew away and landed in other hands, where they could be transformed and remembered differently. Memory is both an image and an imagining.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe0a71dd6-e606-4476-b174-ff091ee0e228_4032x3024.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back in Oregon, the napkin flew toward rainbow-streaked streets. I followed and was brought to an unexpected connection between meditation and inspiration. On a basic level, we navigate the world with a set of feedback-enforced models that shape our future thinking, feeling, and behaving. That is, we operate on mental heuristics that determine what we perceive, how we interpret it, and what we do in response. Sometimes this results in behavior that may not fit the demands of the current moment; it may reflect past patterning more than our truest desires and values. What certain meditations can do, then, is free us from these patterns by enabling clarity and other ways of being. Inspiration and unexpected connections naturally arise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had meditated earlier in the day. I had practiced remaining uninvolved with the contents of perception in the space of “open awareness”, where things could be just as they are. Here they can also potentiate as new interpretations and responses. The napkin could have just been a usual napkin: a cheap product intended for particular uses; trash once touched and used; an object loaded with prior meanings. Instead it transformed into something else entirely. It morphed into a vessel that transported me to pages of memories that were loose in my mind but not entirely lost. All of this is possible should one be open enough to receive and dwell in possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I thought back to the NYC stranger and wondered what she was up to, what kind of life she was living, whether she had transitioned into the design career she longed for. Her name eventually came to mind, and I found her on social media. As I sifted through her posts and images, a smile grew inside of me and made its way to my lips. She’d gotten married and was working as a graphic designer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>30</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/23-08-10-thirty/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ad64a41-cdbb-44b5-aabe-60ddfb78ab12_4032x3024.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hey! It’s my birthday today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had planned to write a longer piece on aging, wisdom, and some other things I’ve learned along the way to 30, but honestly I don’t really want to right now. What I want to do instead is train for my half-marathon, chat with my friends (both old and new, online and off), and read good books. I want to learn new things, write songs and poems, and practice the guitar seriously again. I want to simply participate in the world and see what happens when the page isn’t my focal point anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Much of my interest in writing has been about becoming the kind of person who can write well. Put another way there’s less love in the process of it than I would like to admit, at least relative to other pursuits at the moment. Maybe I’m just trying to excuse myself from the effort required to produce the kind of works I admire and enjoy reading—I’ve looked up to writers for so long. But I’m also tired of operating from a place of needing to prove something, namely that I am interesting and worthy of good company only if I can write well. This was the crux of my personal operating system for the last few years. I’m growing up though and want instead to act solely out of wonder and curiosity. Where this has taken me as of late is to music, to conversation, to novels, to dancing, to people, even to coding and statistics again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So off I go into other lands, for now. I’ll end on a letter I received today from a three-year younger version of myself. (P.S. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.futureme.org/&#34;&gt;Future Me&lt;/a&gt; is awesome!):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dear Future Me,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this right now, happy birthday. You’re fucking 30. Three zero. At the forefront of a new decade in life. Yours. Pretty exciting right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, I hope that the whole coronavirus situation has been dealt with. Although it gave younger you (me) a lot more room to explore various creative pursuits in your free time (guitar, slacklining, rollerblading, etc), it has also been incredibly restrictive in the sense of knowing how the future will unfold. I am leaning into a sharp existential edge at the moment, questioning daily everything I had thought I ever wanted. I still want to travel wide and far for extended periods of time, live in foreign countries, have deep experiences, and so on, but it’s hard to imagine how I will do all of that when the world remains mired in so much uncertainty. These past few weeks in particular have been full of doubts about whether or not I’m on the right path being in the Complex Systems and Data Science program. I’ve been thinking a lot about clinical psychology again, but it doesn’t feel quite like what I want. It feels like I want to run.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whatever you chosen, I hope the decision was made by answering a call to something interesting and exciting rather than a reaction based in fear. Maybe you’re biking across the country like you once said you would. Imagining it now excites the hell out of me. I hope you’re following your gut. Continue creating and sharing with others a life worth living, one you’ll someday write about and regale your children with. I know for certain that the existential questions will never leave you, but hopefully you’re better equipped to hold them in your mind than I currently am. Hopefully by then you’ll also have a greater sense of inner peace and self-compassion. I like to imagine that you’re rocking a new tattoo too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you’re dating anyone, show the lovely lady this letter, kiss her senselessly, and remember what drew you to her: hopefully her positive energy, her infectious laugh, her love of books, her independent and intelligent spirit, the way you can talk about anything with her while trying really hard not to lose yourself in her mesmerizing eyes. Someone kind and understanding, who pushes me to be the best version of myself. Someone you can just BE with. Remember too that great relationships are made in how you hold the tension between knowing and not knowing, distance and closeness, vulnerability and understanding. (And take any advice Younger You is giving with a grain of salt because he’s incredibly naive).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wherever you’re at, I hope you’re happy and proud of what you are doing. It’s tough now, but things tend to have a way of working out for you, whether by sheer luck, grit, or your ability to find meaning in any situation. Tell the people in your life you love them. Especially S for being the voice of reason and unconditional acceptance, the rock who has been with you through every fumble of your adult life, the person who has set the bar high for what it means to be a true friend. Give yourself a hug. Happy birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Dog Days Are Over</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca42c8f1-0364-4496-af61-3c7f8b4c52d8_3022x2741.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every day out the door is a new adventure for you. Each step you take holds within it a possibility, an everything all at once, waiting to burst like the teeth of zippers on jeans too intimate with skin. You bring us to squirrels with peach seeds in their mouths; to robins hopping along the grass on their reptilian feet; to stray humans, walking or jogging, in and out of our line of sight. Whatever it is, at any time of day, the movements of the moment go fully noticed. We walk our well-worn routes, zipping and trotting and bumbling along in search of the forlorn in the familiar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something snaps—a twig, crumbled blades of grass, self-control. You bolt like lightning after the culprit: an empty-handed squirrel. I hold on and think of how envious monks must be of your dogged focus. Nothing escapes the laser of your nose, that porous interface with which you give shape to your world. You’re a subject of impulse, but I want to believe there is intention behind your eyes too. You bring me here after all. While I sift in and out of total awareness around the clock, you swim in the constant stream of the present.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another dog has your gaze, a pup as appealing as a bone. The barking begins, self-consciousness churns. She’s not mine! I’m just her sitter! I pull you aside to quiet you down, but your eyes are fixed. There’s tension on the leash. You want to smell him, assess if he’s a threat, feel out his vibe. Every muscle is contracted, primed to lunge. It’s control and restraint versus freedom and desire. We move into the graveyard that prohibits dogs. The tracks here are quieter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back in the apartment you tease me with your chew toy, pretend to yield it only to yank it away at the last second. I grab it after chasing you for awhile and pull you into a hold. Both of us are feral when we wrestle, though your bites are nips, a pearly kind of playfulness. It astounds me, your ability to discern rough-housing from danger. You could bite my face off if you wanted, and the urge in me to strike back is strong, enlivening, animalistic. Your teeth hit me like a shot of adrenaline, filling me with the energy to crush you like a candy cane—but I grit my own and hug you instead. In the minutes it takes me to make a coffee, you’re already out cold by the foot of my work desk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I look at you in your sleep and remember: once, you pooped three times in a single walk. Only two of the loads ended up in trash bins—I didn’t have enough poop bags on me. Your third proceeded to live rent-free on the corner of some poor soul’s lawn. This is bad etiquette, I know. But we marched on. Guilt can’t morph into shame without any witnesses. You were holier than me: you kept turning your head back. I lean down to kiss the top of your head, and you kiss me back on the ear. Love is dealing with your shit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Birdsong</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/23-07-13-birdsong/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc281577-e6e9-450a-a7e0-8abdb83c0702_720x540.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Elizabeth Anderegg | Macaulay Library&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every morning, I wake to a chorus of birdsong. Sometimes it is accompanied by rain, but mostly there is the sputtering of other early birds. They’re hairy bipeds without the ability to fly, though they do have the ingenuity for it. Today their cars and yet-oiled minds are starting and revving, preparing to drive off to only God knows where in the green mountain state. None of the shops here are open earlier than seven am, so I picture them driving to the head of a hiking trail, Camel’s Hump maybe. It’s possible too that they may be the poor souls who have to prepare the coffee and pastries I will leisure over later while lingering on last night’s fuzzy dreams and their associated meanings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is only the rain and birdsong this morning. I reach for my phone, but an unfamiliar trill seizes my mind: “Da-da-da da-da-da da… da-da-da da-da-da da.” Seven quick notes in three parts per breath ringing in a medium-to-high register, likely from an efficient, small-breasted body. I run through my embarrassingly short and unspecific list of identifiers: Blue Jay, Northern Cardinal, House Sparrow, Robin? The bird app—no not Twitter—&lt;a href=&#34;https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/&#34;&gt;Merlin&lt;/a&gt; confirms that she’s something else. She’s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Carolina_Wren/sounds&#34;&gt;Carolina Wren&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that she is actually a He since the wren can sing. He is singing, I know, because there is a structure and cadence to it. There is also my attraction to his voice, not merely a noticing or narrowing of attention. How something so little can seize the entirety of my awareness remains a delightful mystery. I get up and go to find him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why do birds sing? When I sing, I expend energy that might be better spent elsewhere, especially because I am not attracting potential mates with my voice any time soon. (Though it may ward off possible aggressors.) Improvement is a possibility, though practice and effort is required. The same is true for songbirds. They must learn how to sing just like us. This begins in a critical learning period, where, as nestlings, they are highly attuned to the sounds and songs of their environment, especially those of their parents. They are listening closely as the inner pathways of their language develop. Mechanistically, this is enabled by the syrinx, the feathered equivalent of our vocal box. Once ejected from the nest, they practice replicating the songs and calls of their early days on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They have been awake for awhile now. They are always the first to rise and meet the sun with calls and melodies that color and punctuate the morning air. Scientists don’t know why they tend to sing more at dawn than any other time of day, but I like to believe that they’re grateful for the gift of another sunrise. We should be more like them. It’s possible, certainly, just like it’s possible to become a better singer. Everyone is still asleep though. Even the dogs have yet to yield a yawn, though occasionally I find the eyes of lazed cats through the dark veil of a cross-hatched windowpane.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Carolina Wren has a repertoire of song and call variations that betray his small, brown, teapot-shaped frame. They can be found up and down the eastern coast of the US, singing at nearly all hours of the day, sometimes in duets, defying scientific generalization. I can’t find the one that I’ve set out to find—unsurprising, since they are notoriously difficult to spot visually—but it seems that he has found me. In the woods and the wilds, this is always the case. There is so much here that we cannot see and perceive. And yet it is all aware of us. Every breath and footstep we take reverberates across this vast web of unknowns. We are made part and parcel in its presence, and thus more whole. Only in stillness does the world reveal itself to us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am most content while in rhythm and motion, but the wooded soothsayers have arrested me in lullaby. A mosquito finds my ear; I brush it off and wait. I cannot sit around and read all day, like I usually do. I cannot consider and struggle with the calculus of abstractions at all hours of the clock. I must be outside and walk, too. In the woods, by bodies of water, drenched in sunlight, draped by darkness, my thoughts become something else, less domineering in the frame of existence, no longer my own. The sun is up and the wren continues to elude my gaze, but I am still, waiting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Carolina_Wren/sounds&#34;&gt;All About Birds&lt;/a&gt; is an awesome resource for learning about (and listening to!) numerous species of birds.

      <title>Repetition in Mary Oliver&#39;s &#34;Wild Geese&#34;</title>

It&amp;rsquo;s cliché, I know, and so was the setting: I was feeling lost and lonely while walking the Camino de Santiago, days after my Camino soulmate had finished their pilgrimage. This took place over five years ago, when I was desperately trying to &amp;ldquo;figure my shit out.&amp;rdquo; I lacked any sense of direction and wanted more than anything to feel at home in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This made me feel bad about myself because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t present half the time I was walking. I was wrapped up in finding the answer, as if it were sitting in the back of a statistics textbook. (Spoiler alert: I checked in graduate school&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s not there!) When the weight of the world felt too heavy to carry, I recited &amp;ldquo;Wild Geese&amp;rdquo; to myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t read much poetry growing up. I was more partial to drawing, fiction, Captain Underpants, and video games. So if there was any sort of deeper meaning hidden in the poem, it surely flew in one ear and out the other. The lines served simply as buoys against the uncertainty of the future. Would I have enough money to finish the trip? What was I going to do when it was all over? They grounded me when what I needed most was the smell of Spanish soil.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m revisiting it now with a sharper eye as a way to train my poetic sensibilities, and to gain a deeper appreciation of poetry in general. It seems more critical these days that we cultivate a sense of magic/poetics/the divine given the domineering effects of our omniscient, omnipotent &lt;a href=&#34;https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/exit-the-supersensorium&#34;&gt;supersensoriums&lt;/a&gt;. We need to carve out refuges where we can devote our attention to all that touches our souls, to what can &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20943.How_to_Read_and_Why&#34;&gt;startle us out of our sleep-of-death into a more capacious sense of life.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Poems are well-equipped for the task. They require that the television&amp;mdash;and all our supersensoriums&amp;mdash;be turned off. They demand close, careful, repeated readings. They ask, with all the affordances of paper and time, for our imagination and perseverance. In return, we are put in the presence of enriching company, both dead and alive. Your pockets may not be fuller afterwards, but your hearts may be. This alone is worth more than anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Okay. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a closer look at Mary Oliver&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Wild Geese.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wild Geese&amp;rdquo; is centered around a single arc. The heart of it reassures us that it is always possible to find a sense of belonging in the natural world. What more is it than that? Well, part of what makes a poem a poem is the delivery, how it&amp;rsquo;s composed. Here it feels simple and straight-forward, which is what people tend to love about Oliver&amp;rsquo;s poems. For some this is a point of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/27/what-mary-olivers-critics-dont-understand&#34;&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt;, but simplicity itself is not a vice, nor is complexity a virtue. What matters is how these elements are woven together to give us the poem&amp;rsquo;s intended effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many of Mary Oliver&amp;rsquo;s poems are prayer-like, almost biblical in nature. This is certainly true of her works in the collection Devotions. There&amp;rsquo;s a reverence to them, an expansiveness that I feel after reading her verse when my mind is quiet and open. We can attribute this, in part, to the way she employs repetition. Repetition can be used to reinforce a point or message or felt sense. This can take form in the words themselves, or the images, themes, and feelings evoked throughout a poem. They can damn us, as when used for the ends of shaming, or they can serve as the mantras that heal us over time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m reminded of the ten commandments from the Bible at the beginning of &amp;ldquo;Wild Geese&amp;rdquo;: &lt;em&gt;Thou shalt not kill&amp;hellip; Thou shalt not steal&amp;hellip; Thou shalt not use the word Thou Ten Thousand times in a row&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt; This seems intentional when considering the central image in the first chunk of verse (The set of Yous). We have a &lt;strong&gt;repenting&lt;/strong&gt; individual, one who is walking through a &lt;strong&gt;desert&lt;/strong&gt; on their &lt;strong&gt;knees&lt;/strong&gt; in search of redemption. The word choice and repeating Yous draws on our society&amp;rsquo;s religious roots, suggesting that our wanderer can only be saved by something bigger than themselves. And yet, the section ends with:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You only have to let the soft animal of your body&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;love what it loves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rather than turn outward toward a religious kind of revival, Oliver appeals to our animal selves, to our basic, pre-religious nature. &lt;em&gt;You do not have to &lt;strong&gt;be good&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; she invokes, because goodness is rooted in human morality. We can find salvation elsewhere she suggests, in something more fundamental.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We now arrive to the &lt;em&gt;meanwhiles&lt;/em&gt;. These lines are structured similarly to the &lt;em&gt;yous&lt;/em&gt;, where the first line depicts an abstraction (&lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;world&lt;/em&gt;), the second line an image of nature (a desert, a dynamic landscape), the last an animal (the soft animal of your body, wild geese). Note, too, that the content within the &lt;em&gt;meanwhiles&lt;/em&gt; is growing more vivid relative to their parallel yous, which has the effect of adding richness and momentum to the poem. We are moving from &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;the world&lt;/em&gt;, from &lt;em&gt;the soft animal of your body&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;wild geese&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The expectation as a reader, now, is that some sort of resolution must be reached. We have allowed the soft animal of our bodies to love what they love; we have shared our despair with one another; we have witnessed the evolving landscape, the wild geese flying in the clean blue air. Where is the poem taking us?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the end, Oliver breaks away from her structured repetitions, leaving us with a long verse spilling over several lines. The poem has been building up to this point, repeating itself and its images until at last it resolves into a quiet crescendo. The world is offering itself to you, the wild geese are calling to you, all neatly constrained by the strength of the commas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then no longer. The commas are are overrun, and we&amp;rsquo;re left with a final repetition&amp;mdash; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;over and over&lt;/strong&gt; announcing your place in the family of things&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash;and two enjambments&amp;mdash; &lt;em&gt;harsh and exciting / over and over announcing your place / in the family of things&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; as if, finally, we have arrived, as if the geese and our imaginations are dancing with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Wild Geese” begins and ends the way a river does, from the smallness of you at the mouth of the poem, to the expansive refuge that is available when we widen the aperture of our imaginations. The Yous build us up toward the release of despair. The meanwhiles set the stage and lead us to the image of wild geese heading home, again, implicating that this is always on offer for us. And then the poem ends with a final statement, one that condenses the structure and repetitions that have been strewn throughout, reposing in a sense of arrival:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whoever &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; are, no matter how lonely,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the world&lt;/strong&gt; offers itself to your imagination,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;calls to you like &lt;strong&gt;the wild geese&lt;/strong&gt;, harsh and exciting&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;over and over announcing your place&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;in the family of things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why go through the mess of reading a poem like this? A more direct person might have said to you “if you’re feeling lost and down about yourself, go into nature.” Partly because life often feels like going through the mess of a poem. We receive banal platitudes and thoughtless advice all the time. But we change only when we ourselves embark on &lt;a href=&#34;http://thepracticelondon.org/poetry/poems-of-transformation-the-journey-by-mary-oliver/&#34;&gt;the journey&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes this actually involves working through the nuances of a poem. In the process, you may discover something beautiful. You may find another layer of existence that enriches the way you witness and navigate your life. You may arrive at an answer, or, more than likely, further questions that have the power to guide you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd3f57f0a-9707-44db-82b4-40bc15b7db5a_4028x2610.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We’re grouped on the grass by the lake, somewhere on the periphery of jazz fest, planning a solstice party. Musicians unknown to us enchant and move the crowd, but we are neither enchanted nor moved, mostly because we are plebeians who throw around artless smiles (ty Chekhov for this phrase) like Oprah on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Still, we try to move anyways. We bob and sway and kick and swing and move but fail to dance with swag. Now our artless smiles are accompanied by artless moves. We’re vibing though, which is what counts I’m told.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like this, kind of. We like this. We are happy enough and buzzing because we are surrounded by boats we cannot afford and music we don’t normally listen to and sunsets we get to catch every day and each other. A wolf spider perks up from his den in the crack of a lamppost and joins us. We welcome him and name him something important I know I won’t remember the next day. Our problems are held by the company and music, transformed even, made lighter for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then the Stump game is proposed. E promises the stump will be easy to find and transport to the party. She knows a guy she says. This amuses us and settles the discussion. We’re amused at how easily amused we are. Our smiles are no more nuanced by the end of the night, but they continue to beam as we dream.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s actually there, one week later, in the backseat of her scrappy Nissan, a full tree stump, heavy, thick, and aged, perfect for our purposes. I’m reminded of hands and the way veins contort like bark. The only thing E says about it is that she forgot to put a blanket under it before lugging it into her car. This strikes me as something E would say but not do. She isn’t afraid of a little dirt, is she? It’s so thoughtful of her to think of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We drive to the party with no further questions. We talk about the weather, which ends in the philosophical musings of amateurs and the lightness of unencumbered laughter. I’ve got my guitar, a hammer, some nails. When we arrive I roll the stump out as casually as possible toward the others. They are situated around a bonfire, waiting for our arrival to begin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hammers weren’t meant to be thrown in the air, but neither were humans. This is how G ends up with a bleeding thumb. A plate follows a similar fate, shattering into more fractions than God can count. We continue at it for awhile, flipping the $10 hammer into the sky like jugglers. Some of us catch it more often than others; an even smaller handful manages to sink a nail into the wood. A crushes us in the first round, his first ever, leaving our mouths agape and my mind full of backstories to explain his performance. Something’s not computing because he is a city boy. But before I can ask he’s gone, claiming that he is a reasonable man with work to attend in the morning. No one mentions that we do, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The moon takes its place in the cloudless night, as E steers our attention to Venus hovering right below. We stay and play until we can no longer endure the mosquitoes that have proven they are bolder and larger than life. I’m prepared to sing a song I wrote, but fear chokes me up at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the morning there’s a seagull eating a dead mackerel beside one of the graveyards I frequently walk by. It’s early and he’s alone with me, stabbing his beak into the gill of the lifeless fish with the kind of precision only dreamed of by darts players in speakeasys and statisticians on Twitter. I wonder if he’ll bury it when he’s done, given the nearby graveyard. Surrounding him are the remains of dropped groceries: a half-open can of tomatoes, broken glass, the crispy skin of exposed garlic cloves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The seagull stutters away from the mackerel when I step closer for a better look. He doesn’t want me to catch him feasting on what cannot defend itself. It’s a gull eat gull world I whisper behind crusty eyes. This one has more pride than the rest, though I notice that, when I turn back toward him and his prize, he has his back toward me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He really doesn’t want to be caught eating this fish. He’s not some schmuck of a seagull who vultures around humans all day in the hopes that fate will be kind to him. He’s better than this—he’s a pioneer, a self-made seagull who knows how to find his own food, not a freewheeling freeloader with wings. But we’re connected, too. When I move, he moves. When I turn, he turns. We do our dance for awhile, only to find the back of our respective heads when we try to observe the other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are others in the distance. I begin to picture them as capitalistic graverobbers with top hats and fancy suits that are abandoned when it’s time to eat. And what they eat, in my mind, are deceased humans. To them we’re wasteful; it’s a simple resource allocation problem, and they’re willing to solve it efficiently. Maybe this is why, Ms. Emily Dickinson, they never - in extremity - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42889/hope-is-the-thing-with-feathers-314&#34;&gt;asked a crumb&lt;/a&gt; of you. Maybe they never needed to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I scurry away far enough, I witness him in the act. His beak connects, finds a vein, cranes and twists, until sinew surrenders to strength.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another summer solstice, another beginning and ending all at once.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m trying with all my might to tease apart beginnings from endings because it’s better for the story of my life. But who and what we are is an ongoing process, a tangled knot of beginnings and an endings threaded in a swirl of cosmic hairballs. I’ve had my share of endings recently and want to focus only on this beginning, on one thread. But I know that this wishful thinking, which may never end for as long as I live. The beginnings are the endings are the beginnings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The heat is getting to me. It’s worsening my sleep and blurring the line between one day and the next. It might be the smoke, too, from my Canadians up north. The U.S. army once tried (maybe they’re still trying) to reduce the need for sleep in their soldiers. This makes me sad because these super soldiers would no longer be human. Without sleep we cannot dream, and to dream is to be human.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And yet, we dream more by dreaming less. We forget what we know in our lack of sleep and memory and rely instead on imagination to fill in the gaps. Summer, then, makes us more human by helping us forget who we were, allowing us to shape who we are and who we want to be. The beginnings are the endings are the beginnings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I sometimes dream that I’ll be rich enough to fund the dreams and projects of my friends. One friend wants to build a house in Maine where she and her hens can live. She also wishes for an extra 80 years to live in it, which means that if I am to succeed, I will need the folks working on human longevity to accelerate their work for humans and hens alike.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I dream, too, of finding my traveling companions for the longer walk of life. I think this will include a pup, and surely a wifey and children at some point. It also includes friends and people who are dedicated to lifelong explorations. Ideally they are experts in embodied phenomenology and creative goofology, people who can point to a tree or word or song or yam and make me fall in love with it. They are lovers and rebels and artsy intellectuals, people who can challenge me for the sake of deepening my love for the world. In return I can give my hands and words and energy. I can make something beautiful from the messiness of beginnings and endings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>On psychedelics and change</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/23-06-21-psych-change/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb3fa0c7b-896c-43b4-bdbb-581f4eb9231a_3024x4032.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;📷: Lion’s mane jellyfish I saw at the New England Aquarium!&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hi friends!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A friend recently asked me how my experience on psychedelics have changed me, relative to other major events in my life. This is a hard question to answer, partly because it feels like comparing apples to the Andromeda galaxy. There are way too many variables that would confound a meaningful comparison (apples man!), especially when it comes to a psychedelic trip and, say, my &lt;a href=&#34;https://philintheblank.me/posts#category=Camino&#34;&gt;journey&lt;/a&gt; across the Camino de Santiago. I’ve also only taken them twice, each time with a moderate to high dose for the purpose of personal insight, which is to say I am no veteran of the psychonautic landscape. But I’ll try to provide a tentative answer to what I think is at the heart of the question: how have psychedelics affected my life?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(All the usual caveats regarding psychedelic use stand here. I ain’t a doc and you should not read my words in a prescriptive fashion.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s worth saying at the outset that psychedelics will not solve all of your problems. If you’re facing a difficult decision and/or are seeking to change your life in some significant way, I’d urge you to try addressing these things head-on, first. Travel, read books, talk to people, &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; things differently, patiently experiment, seek your own answers to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://philintheblank.substack.com/p/live-the-questions&#34;&gt;questions&lt;/a&gt; tugging at your soulstrings. Find out what’s behind your desire to use psychedelics and see if you might be able to satisfy it without their use. Committing to this ongoing project will change you! At the very least you will become more intentional about using them, all the while cultivating your sense of personal agency.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’m old school (PSA: apparently 29 is the new 30, ha..!), but I mention this because people tend to avoid the work and devotion that meaningful change requires, even when they’re aware of what they need to do. It’s a long and difficult road, so we sometimes distract ourselves with social media, mindless hook-ups, disembodied philosophies, and grandiose spirituality quests. (Yes God can be a distraction.) This is fine at times. You do not need to constantly Work On Yourself. But know that psychedelics can be a distraction too, one that can make you drastically worse off, especially at the dosages that mediate lasting change. Under their power, you may feel ready to leap into the void, only to later realize that you left your parachute behind because it was ruining the vibe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve used psychedelics before to help me decide whether or not to continue a relationship I was struggling with. On the surface everything seemed fine: I was creatively engaged; I was in good health; I was doing proper grad school things; I was supported in my relationship. But I was also so, so lonely. I felt directionless, incompetent, disconnected from my peers and my work, unsure of myself and what I wanted. I knew I had to change something about how I was living, but it felt like the foundation of my life would crumble if I did.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And it did, not long after the trip. My intention was to understand why I felt so much pain and disconnection when we were together, and to discover a way forward. What came up instead was an indecipherable hurricane of emotions. There was anger, frustration, guilt, shame, resentment, a lack of acceptance, and self-flagellation. There was also warmth, love, affection, and gratitude, too. At some point I tried to play a song on my guitar, only to find that the entirety of my conscious being was content on riding the ethereal reverberations of a single C-shaped D Major chord. This was not part of the Plan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later I went down to the lake to process the experience. It didn’t reveal anything about what I should do, not really anyways. All I knew was that there was a deep conflicting pain inside of me that arose within the context of our relationship. Parts of me wanted to continue, while others wanted to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We broke up a few days later. I felt okay about it as long as I was working or engaged in activity. But the grief welled up inside of me. And then it overcame me like a great, all-consuming wave, one I kept drowning under over and over again. Suddenly academic research felt meaningless. Similarly with writing, exercising, going outside, playing the guitar—everything that once held my life up. A month goes by, and on the drive from my friend’s wedding–which I officiated–I realized that I needed help as I imagined, through merciless tears, what it’d be like if I suddenly drove off the edge of the 89.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F068ebe88-93dc-4c5d-aeb7-94716e88444d_4032x3024.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the wedding, I took a few weeks off from working on my PhD and stayed with my parents in California. Being away from Vermont made me realize how misplaced I felt in academia. It was the available and appealing path, one encouraged by my wonderful lab members, but I did not want to &lt;a href=&#34;https://philintheblank.substack.com/p/i-left-my-phd&#34;&gt;walk&lt;/a&gt; it. A close friend I trusted gave me heartfelt advice and difficult feedback around the same time. It came from a place of genuine concern and compassion, but I was not ready to hear it yet. Any idle moment I had was immediately filled with heaviness and despair, leaving me feeling helpless and trapped. I felt unhinged and alone and afraid that things would never improve.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of my friend’s wisdom must have seeded itself in me though. This, alongside the small but ongoing support of friends and parents, gave me enough inertia to begin helping myself. And then, eventually, I got lucky. I landed a job that allowed me to leave my PhD. I made more proximate friends and widened my circle of social engagement. I reconnected with my ex. (Things ended again later, but on a better note.) I rekindled my creative spirit. (Thank you &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.ellenrhymes.com/RRR&#34;&gt;RRR&lt;/a&gt;, Dialogic Circle, and others!) I sought more help. I started recognizing what was important to me and acted on it. And I got better, bit by bit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The brain seems to become more malleable after psychedelic use, meaning it’s easier for new patterns of thought and behavior to form and settle. This is usually framed in a positive light, but it’s possible that the changes run the other way too. In my case, the post-trip/post-breakup pit I found myself in was potentially deepened by the intensity of my grief and depression. If true, it suggests that extreme care should be taken when considering psychedelically-mediated life changes. It could have gone much worse than it did, and I recommend against making such big changes all at once, at least not without support, nor without having exhausted other options.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Truthfully, what I needed was a robust structure in place to help me transition through the major life decisions I was contemplating. I needed a close friend or two who was consistent and physically there for me; a good therapist, perhaps; work and activity that felt meaningful; a large dose of courage, and the momentum of baby steps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a sense then, psychedelics kind of ruined my life. They enabled me to make a decision about the relationship and later my PhD, but I was unprepared for the immensity of the losses and everything else that quickly followed. In another sense, they saved me. They made me more sensitive and receptive to the signals radiating from my body. They wiped off the smudge marks from my inner compass and revealed the urgency of the work ahead. It’s true that, sometimes, one has to &lt;a href=&#34;https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/in-praise-of-blowing-up-your-life&#34;&gt;completely uproot&lt;/a&gt; their lives and go through hell in order to build a better one, for every person involved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I decided to walk the Camino, it was not an answer to a call for adventure exactly, but rather a lack of options and the necessity of the moment. I had read about it in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.perseusbooks.com/titles/kamal-ravikant/rebirth/9780316312257/&#34;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; and told myself I would walk it one day in the far future. Well, that day came much sooner than I expected. I was working at a summer camp in Maine and had just been denied a job I wanted for when camp ended. Days later, feeling liminal while drifting alone in the middle of a lake on a paddle board, the idea to trek across Spain came to me. It was more a suggestion than a compelling vision, one that was incredibly far-fetched and impractical, but I knew it was what I had to do. I didn’t know how I was going to do it, but I paddled back to shore and immediately booked a one-way ticket to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There I met some very wonderful people. I stuffed my face with Spanish Tortillas. I deepened my felt understanding of love and joy. I began to write more seriously. I fell in love with my &lt;a href=&#34;https://philintheblank.me/posts/14c-letters-soulmate/&#34;&gt;Camino soulmate&lt;/a&gt;. I ran out of money. But there were still parts of me that felt just as lost as I did prior to the journey when I came back home. I still had to figure out where I wanted to live, how to earn an income, and so on, all of which was constrained by a budding sense of urgency (and a negative bank account). I’d been thinking about pursuing a PhD in clinical psychology even before Spain, and this was what I thought I still wanted to do, which led me to Vermont, my home for the past five years. Now I have a masters degree in complex systems and data science, lol.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, Spain changed me I think, but I can’t really tell you how. In many ways I feel like I’m the same person as I was prior to the walk. That’s how I kind of feel now regarding my experience with psychedelics. Perhaps these experiences have allowed me to become more me, which is sadly not always an easy feat. All I feel certain about is that change is hard. And it’s hard not because we resist change itself, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://haleynahman.substack.com/p/voice-note-changing-your-life-without#details&#34;&gt;something else&lt;/a&gt; beneath the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Psychedelics can help you dig beneath the surface and untangle the emotional roadblocks that are preventing you from improving your life. They can tease out old patterns of thought and behavior, and make them more amenable to revision and replacement. This is often the work itself and why people turn to psychedelics. But without the proper scaffolding in place, it’s not improbable that you may fall back into the old patterns you were hoping to change. God may show himself to you, but what will you do about it if he tells you to go home? If he wants to know how you will change your life?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the possibility of revision, we need our earthly visions too, a re-visioning of sorts on a personal and collective level, a concrete sense of where we want to go and who we want to be, if change is to last. Psychedelics can show you what it’s like to feel more connected to yourself, others, and the world, what might be worth aspiring towards. They can open up the door to meaningful change and ease the first steps of a lifelong endeavor. But you will still need to do the work that the universe requires of you when you come back down to Earth. And maybe that work is a stroll across Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks Aly &amp;amp; Shirley for the feedback on this essay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Being held by the world</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/23-06-16-held/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/23-06-16-held/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m going through a break-up. We’d gotten back together months ago and tried to make things work again, but most of the time it was more painful than not. I tried to muscle through the pain, but relationships are not meant to be muscled through. There was always something that prevented me from opening up and being my full self, which inevitably led to distance and disappointment. This made me realize, among other things, that I believed I was never supposed to let others down, especially my loved ones. As a result I let myself down, and her as well. We talked through our issues and wishes and reached a mutual understanding that this was the most loving thing we could do for each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It feels different this time, thankfully. There’s a greater sense of acceptance, a quiet spaciousness and strength that is allowing me to grieve properly. I get sad when I see old photos and our memorabilia (I’m sad writing this!). But I also feel steady and content with the decision. We certainly had our wonderful moments: moments of happiness and grace, of care and forgiveness, of silliness and play. We also put the other’s patience to practice (ha) and learned how to better navigate difficult conversations. Before me she didn’t believe that love was worth fighting for, nor did she think she could feel it so deeply. Now she does. And in more than words and daydreams, I learned what love is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next day I woke up early and couldn’t fall back asleep. I went outside and decided to walk up the bike path by the lake for a few hours. Memories and flashbacks flickered like torches in the dark night of consciousness. Wild Geese later came to mind as I got closer to my destination. I recited the poem a few times like a mantra until I reached the cove. The water was calm, the skies overcast. Beside me were the remains of a recent fire. I reached into the pit for scraps of charcoal and began writing my favorite lines into the rock. A peaceful, trance-like state overcame me. My fingers darkened with each line, and then it was done. I turned toward the dolostone surrounding me and thought of my friend who fell somewhere nearby years ago. It was a 70ft fall, one that she survived.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later I’m approached by two women. They’re friendly and ask if they can look at what I’d written. One of them tells me she’s a native of the land, a woman of the Abenaki. We talk briefly before our eyes settle on the horizon, where the Adirondacks stand grand and timeless. She then asks if she can sing a song for me in the language of her people. Her voice is gentle and reassuring like the wind, firm and strong too like the thrust fault that birthed this place. The song carries itself over three lines I don’t understand but feel held by. In the quiet warmth that follows her last note she hugs me tightly and wishes me well. I run into them again on the way out, and the Abenaki woman hands me a hawk feather and says: I think he dropped it for you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the walk home, I think to myself (and am reminded by a dear friend) that these sorts of things happen to me with a strange frequency. Whoever, whatever is watching over me, all I can say is, I feel held. I see the signs, the doors and invitations, and I know I have to keep walking this way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff2c1b9bf-ad0e-4809-9d81-1cf0d87e38ff_3024x4032.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c46550f-80c2-40cc-8fd4-1617de33e8ec_3024x4032.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s graduation day, a day that seems more important to everyone else but me, not because I don’t find it significant, but because I get to see O for the first time. He’s sleeping when I arrive at N’s parent’s house, so I make my rounds around the room and indulge myself in some food. There’s an assortment of delicious buns from a local bakery, chips and dip of average quality from Trader Joes, homemade mocktails on tap, and I haven’t eaten yet. The house pup greets me like I’m family despite the contrast of my southeast Asian glow to that of the Vermonters I love.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last time I was here was right before I officiated N &amp;amp; M’s wedding. I met N five years ago when I moved from California to Vermont for a job in a developmental neuroscience lab. We shared an office where we often goofed off and talked about science, books, astrology, and other kinds of heady deliciousness for hours. It was a sad day when she moved a couple of feet down the hall—it makes a ginormous difference in the ease of conversation!—and even sadder still when she got accepted to med school. I was happy for her too of course, and thankfully she’d be attending the local university with M! But I knew that med school had the tendency to eat people and their friendships alive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A year or two later, I ran into N at the grocery store. She caught me in one of the darkest moods I’d ever been. We chatted over dinner, and I learned that she was getting married. She was also pregnant and wanted me to officiate her wedding. This put me in one of the best moods I’d ever been. We had made the occasional effort to catch up in town while she was trudging through her first few years of med school, but it wasn’t the same as sharing an office together. So I was ecstatic that she’d chosen me to do the honors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And what an honor it was. Everyone was situated in a beautiful, open field on a blisteringly hot day. A light breeze was present. Umbrellas were docked throughout the ceremony area. I was nervous, but everything went smoothly. I led her family and friends through a short meditation involving oranges and chocolate, quoted David Whyte’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5scnhCFuWiI&#34;&gt;Friendship&lt;/a&gt;, and half-successfully kept my tears in check. N &amp;amp; M sang a cappella together in college. This was central to the formation of their then budding relationship. The night ended on the high note of their individual and duo performances. O was there, steadily growing in the womb, listening to the kind of music that can only be produced by love.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it came time to choose between N’s graduation party and my own graduation ceremony, it was a no-brainer. There too was always a part of me that felt distant from my program and the work I was doing, which I’m still unpacking a bit. Regardless, I’d choose celebrating and seeing my friends over anything any day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’d choose over and over again to bounce O on my leg as he chews and slobbers over a cardboard tag attached to the new plushie his grandmother has just given him. He’s looking at me with innocent eyes, with a gaze free from expectation that puts me ease, scanning the ridges of my face and my acne scars and my darkened skin and my crooked smile like little curiosities, not anomalies that need correction. He has no notion of what it means to size someone up, the way we adults do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He laughs with and at me regardless of whether or not I have a masters or medical degree, even if I am no comedian. He smiles because I have done something funny, and for no reason at all. His wispy tuft of hair reminds me of clouds and cotton candy, his two bottom teeth of pebbles on a gummy coastline. These baby things are kind of amazing, I tell myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think of what science can tell us about babies, about the variability in the development of certain milestones like the ability to crawl, walk, and talk. How fast these things happen—so fast that they seem like discrete events. One moment they’re here, the next they’re twenty-nine years old pondering the nature of things, hopelessly aware of how transient life is. My attention is fixed on him like a laser, as if I can engrave the moment into marble. He looks back at me, and reminds me to soften.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graduation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class = &#34;poem&#34;&gt;&#xA;* We look to our future days&#xA;* with eager eyes to behold—&#xA;* But don&#39;t run so quickly!&#xA;* Too soon you&#39;ll be old.&#xA;* The worlds that need your saving&#xA;* are here with us now.&#xA;* Our minds are the soil,&#xA;* the heart is our plow.&#xA;* Sow the seeds and wait,&#xA;* let the stories be told.&#xA;* Hold your heart steady&#xA;* as our future days unfold.&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;</description>

My knees are talking to me like the old wooden floorboards of a house that has endured a million greasy footsteps while the cool Spring air has learned how to burn like hot coals in my lungs. The sky is so blue and cloudless so why don’t I just stop and walk and enjoy the vastness that is this life my life and oh my god my bed how I miss it so! I want to emerge like a butterfly from his cocoon and be changed, more powerful, but I do not want to change.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sun is staring me down on lap two. Go find someone or something prettier to look at I yell at him. He laughs in response, knowing that he will always be a constant companion. Dust has gathered on the new shoes I bought just for this occasion, and I curse at the ground for being too damn dusty. What are you running from? Maybe I’m running toward something. What is all this work for? For me, for the work itself. Why don’t you have any answers? Because I’m still searching for them. I want to be a butterfly and I don’t know how to be a butterfly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly she’s there on lap three. I do a double take to make sure she’s real. What are you doing here? You don’t belong here. Where do I belong? My legs continue to propel me forward but my body remains twisted toward the heron. She’s standing as still as a statue, scanning the field, searching for her prey. I think of butterflies and Mary Oliver’s Wild Geese. You do not have to be good. / You do not have to walk on your knees for a hundred miles through the desert repenting. So much is moving in her lack of movement. You only have to let the soft animal of your body / love what it loves. I round the bend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lap four comes around and I’m feeling thankful for endorphins and the kind of ingenuity that led to their discovery and hence my own. How little I remember of neuroscience, but she’s still there, my winged muse. Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine. I recount the year’s achings and yearnings, my desire for the kind of certainty I sought through Ellie and her swaying crosshair in The Last of Us. I think of Abby, that bitch, and Joel. Love makes a fool of us, and vengeance too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I end my run and take a final look at the heron. She is a walking invitation for the imagination. She is a suburb brought to life. She flies away, seconds later. Whoever you are, no matter how lonely, / the world offers itself to your imagination. What do you think Mary Oliver? Change doesn’t happen in the blink of an eye, but sometimes everything does change all at once. I dust off my shoes and run another lap.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

When I talk with people I want to perfectly recall the details of their lives—who did what, where, how they felt about such and such—otherwise it makes me feel like a bad person, like I didn’t try hard enough or care enough to give my full attention. Sometimes this is true, as much as I hate to admit. To care is to put yourself out there, meaning that you’ve got to open up your heart, something I struggle with at times. Old wounds. Other times I simply forget things. Facts and abstractions tend to be more salient than what I ate for lunch because they latch onto the mental models I’ve constructed over the years. Though I still like to believe that I will remember the way you made me feel ten summers ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The clerk rings up my book in a slow, unenthused series of motions. His shirt looks like something out of a Gen-Z fashion blog, cheap but chic and trendy. I ask him about it and it takes him awhile to register the question, as if he’d never been asked before. Too much time in cyberspace? Waiting for his response, I start to feel like the annoyingly energetic customer who happens to be in the best of Saturday moods while the underpaid employee is still waiting for the caffeine to clock in. His soul is still waiting for him at the door. “It’s just a meme. Haven’t you seen it?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recall my childhood and the patchy scar dotting my lower back, an unavoidable consequence of boyish arrogance, a mini electric pocket bike, and speed bumps. There too are the times I snuck into the nursery behind my neighborhood with my friends to fight each other with borrowed bamboo sticks on giant dirt mounds. More scars than stars ever counted, but we were all the happier for them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back in the car I think to myself that kids probably don’t do this anymore. It’s shunned even, all in the name of safety and extracurriculars. And why fiddle with dirt and bamboo sticks when there are smart devices, escapes from suburbia only a swipe away? A fraction of them might actually be doing cool things in the digital ether, but I worry about their willingness and desire to remain in touch with the physical world, that place I love and know and respect, one that has nurtured us for generations. “Ok boomer” is probably the proper response to my grievances, but I know I’m not the only one sounding the sirens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I start the engine Keith Johnstone’s Impro comes to mind. Haven’t you seen it? Oh god damnit. Did the kid just put me in my place?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Me and this old guy in the coffee shop aren’t so different. He’s here alone, nursing a coffee with a newspaper he doesn’t seem intent on reading. Not the greatest eyesight, judging by the thickness of his specs. No wedding ring, no agenda for the rest of the day. What differentiates us is that he puts sugar in his coffee while I drink mine black. What does that tell you about our generation?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The shop owner is the subject of his searching gaze, as the old guy is to mine. He’s watching him serve the customers while I continue to sketch my mental caricature. I’m half-reading as to be ready to avert my eyes at the faintest hint of being detected. We like to watch but not be watched. I wonder who is watching me?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then there’s laughter. It’s feminine, open, whole-hearted. The owner is speaking to two women in a tongue I can’t understand, connecting with them in a way that I never could in my younger years. I’ve never been the funny one, but I do amuse myself often. I can live with amusing. A smile crosses my lips upon realizing that he didn’t try as hard with me to make me laugh. This makes me laugh, and I curse him for his indirect comedy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d65e8fb-737b-46cf-ba0f-5aa7a93841b5_942x1492.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Generated using Dream.ai&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ve been experimenting with different forms of writing lately. This post is part of a short story I’ve been working on, which has been both a frustrating and humbling (and fun, at times! lol) experience. I’m not sure if I’ll continue writing them, but it was interesting to try something different. Mad respect to all fiction writers out there, those crazed explorers of the what-ifs that surround us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the beginning there was P.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, there were others too. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;P lived in the singularity alongside other particles within a regime of perfect harmony. They attracted and repulsed one another in equal measure, and any differences between them were negligible and ignored (though P sometimes felt insecure about the frequency of his energy emissions). Overall the particles were happy at this point in spacetime. Questions of existence and meaning never intruded the fray of their timeless paradise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then it happened. Dizzying flashes and an explosion of gregarious magnitude. The weight of everything twisting, contorting, expanding. Time unspooling in a single direction like a ball of runaway yarn. P and the particles colliding in a struggle for cosmic stability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then everything was nothing. Nothingness gave birth to darkness, as well as the shape of our universe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The vast quiet of it all consumed P. He was much more accustomed to the frenetics of his tight-knit home. “I suppose this is it,” P mused. “Whoa, I can muse now.” In the chaos of what we later called The Big Bang, P had gained the ability to convert some of his energy emissions into language and musings. I didn’t believe it was possible until long after I discovered P in my lab.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While admiring his newfound abilities, P was suddenly struck by a passing meteor. Everything around him began to move—no, he was moving, somewhere close to the speed of light. Stars, amorphous gases, distant galaxies blazed past him in a blurry haze. The meteor veered in various directions as the gravity of interstellar objects tugged at his vessel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t long, in the grand scheme of things, before P arrived at Earth. The deep blues of the ocean seized him, as did the scale of the mountains that consumed his view. The meteor was losing altitude, and seconds later it made contact with the Earth. There was gravel, stillness, and snowfall.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That’s when I detected the signal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Where are we?” P asked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Particle collider,” replied a particle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Confusion radiated from P. “Come again?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“The humans,” another particle said. “They want to better understand us. And to do that they need to destroy us.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“They need to? Why can’t they just ask us questions?” P asked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“When all you got is a hammer, everything is a nail,” another particle replied. “It’s a human phrase.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;P grew puzzled. “And what does that mean?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“You’ll understand once you’ve traveled the length of human history I have,” the particle said.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kirin and I extracted the meteor a few hours after we discovered it in the Juras mountains. We were told that this sort of thing happened all the time, anomalous meteor crashes, though their structural integrity was often compromised in the descent through our atmosphere. Any fragments that did make it through were thought to have nothing interesting left to say about the universe. But to me, any object of space that managed to find its way to the surface of our home was a kind of miracle. It was proof that, for all of our collective ingenuity, there were still some things we could not predict with certainty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suppose this was what separated me from the others. They were happy to spend their days in the comfort of mathematics, branching out only when the equations suggested they do so. I was content with this too, at least for a while. But I had always wanted to reach beyond the equations themselves. I wanted to look at the universe with my own eyes and let it take me where it would.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The electromagnetic field released its hold again. P buzzed in frustration. “How many times are they going to do this?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“They think that there is something more fundamental than us,” a particle said. “Smashing us together will reveal the answers. So it goes!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Of course there’s something more!” P beamed at the walls. “I mean, it can’t just be us, right?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another particle phased into view, one emitting a frequency that suggested wisdom and timelessness. “Depends on what you mean by us. Regardless, you cannot force the answer to reveal itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The elder particle paused before continuing. “Humans aren’t so different from the other advanced civilizations that have risen and fallen throughout the history of the cosmos. Each one was intelligent in their own right and eventually faced the mystery of what constituted their universe. That led many of them to us, and many theories were constructed in their attempts to understand our nature, but they all failed for one simple reason.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other particles vibrated along their axis of knowingness, as if they had already heard the message a million times over. P whirred with anticipation. “Why did they fail?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“They never tried to communicate with us,” said the timeless particle. “All of them were capable of developing machines to measure, manipulate, and probe us, some more advanced than others. The device we currently find ourselves in, this particle collider, is one such tool. But none ever came close to opening a line of communication.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The timeless particle emitted a sigh. “We have tried of course, many times, from our end. But every civilization has missed the message.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“What about the particists?” interjected another particle. “And here in this universe, the panpsychists?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Every civilization had its subset of intelligent organisms who found issue with the methods and technologies of their time. They intuited that something was amiss in the promises of their advances. But no one listened to them, even the ones that played physics proper to the highest degree.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Such hubris is often a consequence of advanced intelligence,” added another particle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“It must be terrible to feel like an outsider in your own society,” another particle mused.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Indeed,” replied the elder particle. “In their attempts to resolve their existential loneliness, they end up ignoring it in the pursuit of knowledge. What they forget is that there is more to knowing than knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the elder particle was seized by the electromagnetic field, along with several other particles. Before P and the remaining particles could protest, his fellow particles were smashed out of existence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The meteor survived entirely intact, which was unusual. Additionally our scanners had probed it and detected several foreign signals. My peers dismissed it as noise, but I pushed harder for the experiment. We had just finished repairing and upgrading the collider after all—why not test it on new material? There was a part of me that believed the meteor might yield the missing predictions of The Standard Model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Standard Model theorized the existence of fundamental particles and how they interact. It was later tested in several experiments, ultimately revealing what was thought to constitute the ‘stuff’ of our universe—well, most of it anyways. The field promptly celebrated and moved on to other topics, but I continued to be compelled by the missing fundamental force.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tried for decades to understand what it might be, its role in the cosmic scaffolding, only to ever arrive right back where I started. Some theorists posited that it was linked to gravitational forces, but I suspected at the time that it might be something more, something bigger and more conseqeuntial than gravity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“In all my travels, I’ve never seen anything like this,” a particle mused. “Matter is supposed to be conserved—transformed even—but never destroyed. What they’re doing… it’s not supposed to be possible…”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What troubled P the most was the loss of each individual consciousness. Every particle was something special, irreplaceable. New consciousnesses could be formed and reconfigured as particles interacted with one another throughout the course of a universe’s life, but never erased from the fabric of existence itself. That something so fundamental could cease to exist shook P to his core.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“There has to be a way to communicate with them,” said P. “They don’t understand the implications of their actions.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve tried already,” replied another particle. “Distress frequencies, light projections, radiation… nothing has been able to get their attention.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;P orbited around the collider, searching for a structural weakness, the possibility of escape and contact. “Perhaps the only way is to disrupt their operations,” P mused. “Get them to stop their experiments.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“How?” replied another particle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“By speaking their language.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>The meaning in the sea</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1523486230352-65ff5222cea4?crop=entropy&amp;amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;fm=jpg&amp;amp;ixid=MnwzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxvY3RvcHVzfGVufDB8fHx8MTY3ODIwNDUyOQ&amp;amp;ixlib=rb-4.0.3&amp;amp;q=80&amp;amp;w=1080&#34; alt=&#34;Masaaki Komori&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you read something in a book that is so moving that you can’t help feeling that something in you has literally shifted. This was the effect of chapter 28 of Ray Naylor’s “&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.raynayler.net/&#34;&gt;The Mountain in the Sea&lt;/a&gt;.” The book is, in part (there is so much in here!), an exploration of AI, octopuses (yeah, it’s octopuses, not octopi, due to the Greek origins of the word), and the ends that sentient beings will go to preserve themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In times of distress, the domain of our objective functions are flattened to the sole aim of self-preservation. In the process trust is diminished, aggression and vigilance rises, others become means to an end rather than ends in themselves. Sometimes though, in the trenches of our struggles, we produce art, as if it were a necessity. There are things that must be said given the precariousness of the situation, forms of expression that must come out of us if we are not only to survive, but also retain the soul of our humanity. That may be one function of art, if we are to give it one among its many pluralities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An enclave of octopuses are being spied on from a camouflaged vessel. The humans have been tasked to do so in an effort to exploit what they don’t yet know about intelligence. They once believed that the octopus was a creature of solitude, one whose life span is like that of a firework, here and then gone in a brilliant blink in the grand scheme of things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What they find is something to the contrary. The cephalopods are also capable of communicating with one another in a form that feels both foreign and familiar to the humans. The octopus at the center is dashing off symbols into the oceanic ether. There is repetition and a cadence to the act, and then the humans realize it: the octopus is performing a poem. It’s unclear what it means. But there is something haunting and beautiful to the act as their world is being fished out of existence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it all really does boil down to a survival function. But I’d like to think – to believe – that we live for something more, that more is living for something beyond what evolution had in mind. What survives matters. We must look beyond our genes. Beyond our bodies. Beyond utility. Perhaps we must look beyond terraria too and into the umwelt of the other worldly creatures we share a home with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

This sort of thing fills me with an unreasonable amount of hope for the world. She’s engrossed by the colors and a sea of static faces, as if in rebellion against the digital ocean designed to captivate us more than the ocean itself. We are drowning in the currents of the former, without any sense of beauty and movement from the latter. Fully garbed in pink, she’s delighting in showing her mother and her mother’s friend the simple happenings that populate the pages. The words are animating her young mind and soul. Her voice has filled the entirety of the café, as she bounces between being herself and the seeming fictions. The line between the two is fuzzier than we think. I don’t want to moralize, but I feel that the parents are doing something right. I see it in the ease of the child’s laugh, the joy that spreads across her lips as she plays in the ocean of her imagination. It’s thanks to her that I feel my younger self has been freed to dive aimlessly into The Mountain in the Sea, to meander in a world inspired by our own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

I was looking out the window of a coffee shop at a heap of snow recently formed by an overnight storm, when suddenly my eye caught it: a small white dot on the window, and above it, a trail following a sud of soap. “Baby making in progress” was my first thought. Baby making in progress. I rolled my eyes and laughed at myself. Jesus, I thought. He would be disappointed. I was then brought back to high school health class, which reminded me of the young female teacher my friends and I oogled on the daily like helpless puppies. I don’t think we learned much in that class, but I do remember how strange it was to watch the movie on baby making. You know the one. Heavily pixelated, generic voiceover, 1990s feel to it. We, the freshmen, were deemed mature enough, supposedly, to bear witness to the miraculous, complex machinery of our collective conception. I watched, mesmerized, as animated swarms of sperm raced shoulder to shoulder in an attempt to create new life, to give themselves over for the continuation of our species. Not all of them would make it the narrator said with dramatic indifference. But, as if it were inevitable, there would be an eventual winner. There had to be, he said. That’s the promise of obsessive single-mindedness, singularity of purpose. All they ‘wanted’ to do, all they ‘lived’ for (how lovely and unavoidable our tendency to anthropomorphize) was this. And, perhaps, to stun naive, unlearned high schoolers in Southern California. I was a hopelessly lost child who knew only of video games and brotherhood. That was life, just me and the boys (though sometimes girls were involved too). But perhaps I wasn’t so different from the little swimmers that trained day in and day out within the confines of my developing body. They were my first clue that you didn’t need much to get far in life. All you needed, maybe, was intention and the willingness to swim. How delightful it is then that I am where I am, a decade and a half later, giving thanks to gravity, a watermark, a dried up soap sud, and the beautiful machinations that animate our minds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

Try to hide on Hyde Street and you will eventually be barked at by Foxy the coyote-looking dog. Pop into Kru Coffee and ten of them will be waiting in line with you for your daily drip. You cannot escape them when you’re out and about in the city wilds, and that is a good thing, a very good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to thank the humans that accompany them for being the kind of people who are willing to raise a dog, or at least for letting me, a petless, heady person, be a beneficiary of their desire and capacity to care for something other than ourselves. These folks are the public servants of joy, even if sometimes they themselves are joyless. To these individuals I am sorry for not acknowledging this, the invisible pain you sometimes carry, but your dog is way too cute for me to notice. I am a sponge for vicarious delight and want to soak up every ounce of happiness produced by your four-legged fur baby. Most of you, though, seem pretty happy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today one ran up to me while I was sitting at my usual table with my usual thoughts at my usual coffee shop. He stared at me for a good few seconds, and in those seconds, I felt as if he could see straight through the armor I wear. The curls covering his eyes, his scrappy disposition, all of it was enough to bring me into a weightless reverie. My worries dissipated as the moment focused in on the singularity between us. When he returned to the side of his human to receive his daily treat, I remembered what can come of surrender.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

The way it clumps, every molecule hanging together, shaped by the objects it falls on, are nothing without the whole. Its individual motes are sparkly and luminous under certain slants of sunlight. Much like us, they rely on the sun for their beauty. Snow and sand form deserted deserts in the night, free from the people and light that gave them attention. Who are we without the eye of another? Is the existence of everything instantiated by—dependent on—the existence of everything else?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Snow is formed by the lack of movement, molecules of water no longer repulsing, each attracted to the other by forces outside their control. These forces lead to its collective dance in the winter, the way it spreads over the land, trees, branches, windows, windshields. Like germs and pollen you can’t shield yourself from its consuming embrace, try as you might. With it comes the cold that pierces our layers, reminds us what it means to be alive, that life requires a certain degree of exposure, a level of vulnerability to what is outside our control. One morning it’s a winter wonderland, the next a sea of gray slush, an inconvenience for the commuters, though the birds don’t seem to mind. They continue to sing despite the weather.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first time I saw snow I was in Times Square. It was my first time in New York City. Each drop was illuminated by buzzing signs and large billboards. Faces and feet blurred past me as I stood against time with with my body turned toward a sky dotted by snow. Snow, more sticky than the pixels we feed ourselves on. Snow, that reminder of change and seasons, that there is beauty in the extremes. Snow, the seasonal friend of rocks and graveyards who always returns. It always does.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am sitting at a café (so French and proper of me to include the accent over the e) that I frequently visit, a black coffee and The Book of Delights in hand. Ross Gay is a genius and delight. Every word of his makes me smile. (So wonderful that words can do such a thing!) I’d like to meet him and see the world through his eyes. His book is the next best option. Right now the sun is beaming through the window, windows I’ve gazed through countless times, as snow melts from the grooves of the rooftop above me. Who am I telling this to you ask? You, the precious table I always sit at. How many others have spilled coffee upon your surface? How many crumbs of biscuit and croissant have you yourself tasted, each colored by the mouth of tasty, chatty, quiet, solemn strangers, lovers and potential lovers, people with fates yet decided, all over your solid body, a catchall for leftovers and conversation and contemplation? Every day is new to you, even when it’s me and my crumbs again. Familiarity doesn’t scare you. All you need is attention, because despite all appearances, you are quite neglected, though it doesn’t make you too unhappy if you had to be honest, especially those split seconds when the barista is in the bathroom and the patrons are out and off to do something responsible with themselves (like work and taxes), leaving you to bask in the sun and silence, right until the door opens again and a stranger like me sits with you, perhaps to write out these exact thoughts, which are to be enjoyed over other surfaces, in beds, on screens, with coffee and a biscuit perhaps, over other wooden tables somewhere else in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Debate and Dialogue</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve felt combative recently whenever a new view or idea that differed from my own was presented to me. I’d catch myself feeling this way but would then be too preoccupied with the residue of my self-frustration to course correct in real time. The result was that I learned and contributed less than I could have had my stance been more open and curious, less debate-y, more dialogic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is a consequence of my brief stint as an academic. In constantly having to defend and justify my research, I learned that it’s easier to break things down than to build them up. Regardless, it’s not the most pleasant or fruitful way of being. It tends to leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth, a sense of what’s wrong and problematic but no clarity as to what could be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rhetoric is the rule rather than actual conversation in debates. The motivation is to crush your opponent, ideally in style and wit, to outplay the other in a game of verbal jiujitsu while defending your tightly held views. Learning is secondary to winning, and you tend to become more mired in what you already believe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, in dialogue, everyone is on the same team. People build off of each other with the intent of creating something more beautiful, something no one could have done on their own. The conversations can still be heated, but they’re engaged in with the understanding that it’s part of something shared. The winners are those who keep playing through their ongoing participation. It’s a game that never ends.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There’s a place for debate, like, in actual debates. But I’d wager that we’re better off orienting toward dialogues. This might seem too chill for some, but it’s a serious task to be the kind of person who can build and lift others up. The world is already full of people, institutions, and narratives that will try to reduce your soul down to a nub. But if you can keep your light alive and kindle that of others, you’re already ahead of the curve. You can see the exit out of the rat race and want to point others toward it too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We need more of this, more a sense of vision and possibility, both on a personal and societal level. A lot of people I know are too good at being critical of what we don’t understand, myself included. It’s our defense against against the loneliness and uncertainty, against the creep of collective nihilism and helplessness. Sometimes debating and criticizing is fun and necessary even, but it gets tiring after awhile as a form of engagement with the world. I want to focus on more of what I&amp;rsquo;d like to see, to integrate criticality as a tool that bolsters optimism, not something that diminishes it, as I stray beyond the walls of academia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ode to the guitar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is it the harsh grief&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;that pours out of you,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;your thrumming beats, or the&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;                    buzzing of wings:&#xA;is this what I&amp;rsquo;ll recall?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or are you&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;more thoroughly thrilling&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;in silence,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the dove schematized&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;or a woman&amp;rsquo;s hip,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;a pattern that emerges&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;from its foam&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and reappears: a turgid, tumbled&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and resurrected rose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;from &lt;em&gt;Odes to Common Things&lt;/em&gt;, Pablo Neruda&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, while visiting my parents for the holidays, I noticed an acoustic guitar in my brother&#39;s room. &lt;em&gt;This is new,&lt;/em&gt; I thought. &amp;quot;Dad got it for me,&amp;quot; he said in a disinterested tone. Curious, I took it back to my room, looked up some &lt;a href=&#34;http://tim.blog/2012/12/11/how-to-play-the-guitar/&#34;&gt;guitar basics&lt;/a&gt;, and began to play with it. My fingers pulsed with pain and self-hatred by the end of the hour, but a new world had opened up for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after returning to Vermont, a pandemic took storm. This prompted my lab to halt data collection, leaving me alone with long stretches of unoccupied time. I had taken the guitar home, but sadly it had been neglected up until this point. I had tried to learn too much at once&amp;mdash;chords, scales, triads&amp;mdash;when what I needed was something simpler, a focus on building immediate confidence and consistency. The key was diving straight into songs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started with &lt;em&gt;Georgia&lt;/em&gt; by Vance Joy and fell in love with fingerstyle guitar. Think &lt;em&gt;Stop This Train&lt;/em&gt; by John Mayer, &lt;em&gt;Bloom&lt;/em&gt; by The Paper Kites, &lt;em&gt;I Will Follow You Into the Dark&lt;/em&gt; by Death Cab for Cutie. It felt richer and more melodic than songs dominated by traditional strumming (which I later learned has its own subtle beauty and stylistic complexity). I had more fun playing this way too, despite the upfront difficulties. Perhaps from years of PC gaming, my fingers felt arthritic and clumsy as they each struggled to produce sound. But it got better the more I practiced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What kept me going was the joy of witnessing consistent progress. Difficult song progressions and impossible chord shapes always became less so with time and effort. I would often wake up the next day and feel that my fingers were more fluid, my mind and body more relaxed when I practiced again. And soon enough the songs were mine. They weren&#39;t free from blemishes and technical mistakes, but they were my own. Sound had become music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%253A%252F%252Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Fa69d22e4-6e18-46b9-a811-6bae0eac0fbc_785x544.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Chop Suey!&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Song tutorials start to feel unsatisfying after a certain point. You still want to do exactly what that one musician on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hxpiFn1DQU&#34;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; can do, their heads and bodies bobbing in unison with the flight of their nimble fingers across the fretboard. But you also want to know, like, &lt;em&gt;how and why does it all work&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;em&gt;How does everything fit together the way it does?&lt;/em&gt; You want to close down the open chords, break free from the cage of the CAGED system, go full System of a Down, and Rage Against the Machine of tutorial land.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This happened around the year mark for me. I had a few crowd pleasers up my sleeve&amp;mdash;augmented by my preference for everything fingerstyle&amp;mdash;but I had no sense of musicality, no feel for what was possible, no voice or groove of my own. I could play songs and noodle a tiny bit, but I sensed that there was much more to music than my ability to reproduce a song (duh). A return to the basics was needed. Theory, drills, strumming, picking, rhythm, ear training, listening. All necessary ingredients in developing as a musician of any caliber.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had trouble with this because I had no idea how far I wanted to take my play. The guitar had become a refuge, a spiritual practice of sorts that centered me in difficult times, but I had no burning desire to be a musician. At the end of the day though I felt the nagging urge to improve. I wanted to understand and speak the language of music, even if it meant I had to babble for awhile. It brought me so much joy, so why not go deeper?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s where I&#39;m at now, two years later. I continue to learn songs from YouTube tutorials and have more music theory under my guitar strap. I have a couple of songs and melodies of my own too. The guitar feels less foreign, though I suspect it will forever remain a beautiful, humbling enigma. Brilliant musicians intuit the theory they need as they play, record, and perform. But the rest of us&amp;mdash;the hobbyists and amateurs&amp;mdash;need to learn (and practice) it daily, slowly, deliberately. Even &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-MAYC4k15Y&#34;&gt;Tomo&lt;/a&gt; Fujita&amp;mdash;John Mayer&#39;s guitar teacher&amp;mdash;drills the chromatic scale every morning before practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the process you will stumble and drop your pick in the belly of your guitar for the millionth time, leading you to shake it overhead with the unconstrained fury of an adolescent gamer (oh, the poor poor guitar). Self-doubt will be a constant companion, but so too will grace and humility. Why keep going you might ask yourself when you will never be as good as John Mayer, John Butler, Jing Lin, Sungha Jung.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because, some days, all it takes is a single note to bring you home. To make you feel safe, heard, understood, like all is right with the world. Some days those notes string themselves together and form something that awakens a dormant part of you. And then, if you&#39;re listening, your heart begins to sing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How it started (around March-April 2020, Georgia by Vance Joy). I struggled so hard with this haha:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;350&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sHlXgeCXoMI&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How it&#39;s going (short practice session, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTQyofHm3cw&amp;amp;list=RDMM&amp;amp;start_radio=1&#34;&gt;Like a Star&lt;/a&gt; by Youngso Kim).

I wanted to learn about what academic research entailed after returning from my long trek in Spain and decide whether or not graduate school was right for me. I liked learning, diving down intellectual rabbit holes, and talking to people, so a PhD in clinical psychology seemed like a reasonable career path.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Along the way I took an introductory data science course. This sparked a surprising interest in programming and statistics. I liked it so much that I started building Shiny apps for fun to help the researchers in my lab with their projects. Later on one of the lead investigators told me about the Complex Systems and Data Science program and encouraged me to apply. It seemed worth checking out given my new curiosities, so I began completing the prerequisites (I studied psychology in undergrad and had virtually zero college math under my belt) and eventually applied to the masters program. I was accepted to start in the fall of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the interim I explored a bunch of other stuff too. I journaled daily, wrote poems, and devoured books. I formed friendships with people from around the world, learned how to handstand and slackline, and fell hard for the guitar. What I wanted most was to discover what I loved. Certainly learning and self-directed play was a big part of the picture. Nothing else made me feel quite as alive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;explain&#34;&gt;Explain&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did well in my masters courses and enjoyed what I was learning, but I wasn’t that excited about doing academic research. I knew this well before starting graduate school while &lt;a href=&#34;https://philintheblank.me/posts/rome/&#34;&gt;reflecting on&lt;/a&gt; my first independent research project.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I didn’t enjoy it. I bemoaned the literature reviews, academic writing, and how little inherent feedback I received from the work. I never really knew if I was moving in the right direction, and what was deemed a discovery was less than thrilling to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I was missing the bigger picture, I thought. They weren’t merely hunting for p-values; they were asking and refining questions, proposing and testing hypotheses, defining and advancing science. My optimism was often revived when I reminded myself of this. But when it came to actually doing the work, my mind was resistant and someplace else. Perhaps I liked the idea of becoming a scientist more than actually being a scientist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I hadn’t yet considered what I would rather do, what else I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do, where else I would go if I graduated with my masters. My personal and creative pursuits certainly wouldn’t pay the bills, nor did I really want them to. I also didn’t want to compromise and settle for any ol’ job either. The ones within reach seemed boring in comparison to the academic air I breathed on the daily. In truth it was all I knew, and I didn’t want to face the hard choices that would have to be made if I took my ambivalence seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also liked the people in my lab. I’d been with them for four years and felt comfortable with the team and the work we did. So when conversations regarding the PhD came around, I wasn’t surprised that they thought I’d be a good fit. It just made sense on paper. I had the necessary background and skillset, and it was a seamless process to bump me up from masters to PhD student.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I’d learn to like doing academic research too, given enough time. The idea of it and all the romantic antics it encompassed still had appeal: the creative freedom, working in the space of ideas, contributing interesting science, being mentored by smart and driven people. I wanted to be like them. I wanted develop the kind of mind that could find disparate connections amidst the unseen affairs of the universe. The start date was June 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;create&#34;&gt;Create&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something is off. Sitting in my apartment, alone, eyes glazed over a research article on the relationship between competence and resilience, a sad irony is rippling through my body. My will to continue is breaking despite my growing scientific aptitude.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I’ve forgotten to account for a hidden variable, a lurking confounder that is inflating the magnitude of my expected effects. Maybe there’s a non-linearity at play. Maybe I don’t understand the terms and definitions, the rules of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Definitions: Resilience is positive adaptation in the face of adversity. Resilience is the capacity of a system to bounce back from unanticipated perturbations. Resilience is a framework for studying and understanding how individuals overcome risk exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They’re worried. He asked me why progress has been so slow. &lt;em&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; project.&lt;/em&gt; My body tenses at the thought. &lt;em&gt;Are you still interested in it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the dynamics have changed. It’s possible that my priors are ill-informed too. But if the equation describing the system has been wrong the entire time, then its solution is utter nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I sketch the play by play and review the parameters of my project. I run through my assumptions and spot it almost immediately: an ecological fallacy. Effects at the population level don’t always translate to individual differences in process and outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I close my laptop and walk out into the November air. &lt;em&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; project.&lt;/em&gt; It’s refreshing. The last leaves of fall falling, winter on the horizon, the light darkness draped over the city. &lt;em&gt;Are you still interested in it?&lt;/em&gt; The sun sets at four these days, so it’s hard to see where I’m going. But I remind myself that we were all born in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;share&#34;&gt;Share&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not long after accepting the position, I knew that the PhD wasn’t right for me. Adverse bodily symptoms started appearing despite any obvious indicators of poor health: sharp headaches, chest constrictions, difficulty breathing, poorer sleep. It was also increasingly difficult to relax and do things I normally enjoyed. Guitar chords sounded duller, rest felt less restful, and I constantly felt on edge. And during work hours, rather than ask and chip away at research questions, I made pretty plots, refined my code, and learned more statistics. The latter tasks were important, but I was avoiding what was supposed to be my central focus as a budding &lt;em&gt;researcher&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The signs were there but I continued to doubt if leaving was what I needed to do. I was still working through some personal things, and maybe, I thought, this was what I needed to focus on instead. Maybe the work itself wasn’t the issue, but rather my attitude toward it and the role (hole) I expected it to play (fill). Maybe there was a set of counterfactuals that I hadn’t yet considered. Maybe I wasn’t trying hard enough. Maybe I could science the shit out of a personal dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I feared was not knowing what would come next. I had no plan, no vision for myself and the life I wanted to build, which was yet another sign that I had some serious reflecting and exploring to do. This would take time, time I felt I didn’t have in my struggle to remain semi-sane. But slowly, I began to feel that it was okay to leave without a clear sense of direction. That rest and space were necessary prerequisites for clarity and action. That wanting &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to be different was enough of a reason to go.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Baby steps were taken. I started applying to a few jobs, all of which I was rejected from. I expected as much and took each one as a lesson in humility and a reminder that interesting work could be found outside the ivory tower. Every interview boosted my confidence and sense of optimism. And then I got lucky. I really liked this particular team and they me, the projects they were working on, and their relationship to the work. It felt like a good fit, and it felt even better knowing that this was more than enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It still wasn’t easy to take the final steps of leaving my program—some mourning for everything that doesn’t work out is always necessary, as a close friend put it—but for the first time in what felt like forever, I was willing to embrace the new unknowns before me. I wanted to see what was possible on the other side of fear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;serious-play&#34;&gt;Serious Play&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The game was to produce academic papers—publish or perish as they say—and I didn’t want to play this way. I was too slow and too focused on details that were interesting and fun for me but ultimately hindered my research progress. I was more content supporting researchers with the technical skills I had and focusing my creative juices on other things. Some attention has been given to the kind of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01516-2&#34;&gt;role&lt;/a&gt; that would have suited me, but the support and incentives just aren’t there yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prior to starting the PhD, my Dad told me that I was more likely to leave the program than I was to perform poorly. He knew that my ambitions had always been personal, and it was true. I told a friend two years ago that “I’d be happy doing this for the rest of my life—reading, writing, practicing guitar, making stuff, no matter how insane or poorly, in good company.” I want to honor this more intentionally in the coming year now that my job situation feels more settled, especially the good company.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The company I want to have is with the kind of people with whom I could easily list as emergency contacts for the soul (practically speaking would be nice too haha). I want to be better company for others too. This involves being kinder to myself and more comfortable with my quirks and way of being. It also means giving love to others more freely, and expanding my sense of what love is and can be. And touching grass more often, as the kids are saying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In retrospect it seems like leaving was always going to be the outcome. But it certainly didn’t feel easy or inevitable, and it wasn’t just about the PhD. There were many psychological hoops that I had to jump through to get here. Part of me still doesn’t believe how dark it got at certain points, how hard it was to move through and process, where I’m at now with regard to feeling whole again. I see and feel now that the project of fulfillment is messier than the abstractions we use to define and chase it. It’s more like a garden that requires constant care and attention than it is a to-do list to check off, an emergent property of a system in motion, something irreducible to the sum of its parts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m glad I tried it. I learned &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;, especially about the context within which science is conducted. I have a better sense of how science really works and appreciate more fully the fact that there are real humans behind it. Messy, passionate, beautifully flawed humans united by the fundamental impulse of discovery. It’s not the impenetrable, monolithic enterprise I once thought it was. It’s something even better. Maybe I’ll return, one day. Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I still don’t know what I want to do for a “career”, and I still don’t quite have a sense of the role I want it to play in my life. But I have faith that I’ll figure it out as I go, the way I always have. I want to regain the trust of my instincts and feel more comfortable in uncertainty. What I need is to grow up a little and see the bigger picture again, that the exit is also an &lt;a href=&#34;https://philintheblank.substack.com/p/my-lifes-work&#34;&gt;entrance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Things</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/10-30-22-things-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/10-30-22-things-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t always remember the nuances and interesting bits of my day. &lt;em&gt;Things&lt;/em&gt; is thus a weekly post containing poems, articles, and other forms of media I&amp;rsquo;ve consumed over the week. There may also be brief and miscellaneous reflections too, mostly reminders to myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nahhhlina.tumblr.com/post/631910184201142272/ode-to-emptiness-sally-wen-mao&#34;&gt;Ode to Emptiness&lt;/a&gt;, by Sally Wen Mao. What a beautiful poem. I&amp;rsquo;m in love with the underlying sentiment that there is the possibility of finding something sweet and special in the ordinary. To try and look for this sweetness is sometimes an act of necessity and survival. It can be hard to do, especially when you&amp;rsquo;re constantly mired in the depths of some struggle, but it may be the steady lifeline that pulls you to shore.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/10/10/are-you-the-same-person-you-used-to-be-life-is-hard-the-origins-of-you&#34;&gt;Are you the same person you used to be?&lt;/a&gt; I find this question to be endlessly fascinating. I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m the same person as I was years ago, but I&amp;rsquo;ve also matured and am more aware of my patterns. Does that make me a different person though? The boring and short answer is it depends.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/mental-illness-is-not-in-your-head/&#34;&gt;Mental Illness is Not in Your Head&lt;/a&gt;. The author explores and validates a lot of the impressions I&amp;rsquo;ve had regarding academic research on mental health. We are still contending with what mental health really is, which clearly affects the way we study and treat it. It seems silly to me to assume that mental health is something that is confined to some region or piece of the brain, without considering that the brain is embedded within a system of systems that constantly interact with each other. Also, as the piece highlights, the evidence just isn&amp;rsquo;t there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;</description>

The lake. My lake. I go to her, often with my solitary self, but she always makes room for this and so much more. Her temperamental mood and shy whispers have a way of stripping off the straitjacket of my loneliness. It’s a concerted effort sometimes, but we both prefer the tango to the waltz, the dancing to the music. We like the struggle and the kind of fire that warms our souls. Our bodies will take care of the rest. Blades of grass and pebbles of rain are our only witnesses. The trees are too proud to watch, and the stars have done it all before. Poor souls: they don’t know what they’re missing out on. Forgive us as we join blood to water. Dead leaves are falling all around us. It’s the most romantic thing in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There’s the smell of a storm in the air, a sense of communion in the electricity that flows between a man and his sky. It’s easy to believe that I am connected to something bigger than the infinity stretching before me. Thin rays of light are piercing the thick gray blanket in places it probably shouldn’t, as if God had something else to say about life. I’m one word, one look, one slight mishap away from falling back into the void. But today I make room for that too. I throw my hands toward the beams and breathe in the smell of dead leaves and feel what it feels like to be a vessel of lightning, a container and a universe that contains other universes. If God has something to say I’m already on my knees.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Look at all the happy people. Runners running from death instead of themselves. Boatsmen anchoring into the depths of their yearning. The elderly, coupled and strutting without an ounce of regret in their step. The homeless finding salvation in the shared end of a burning stick. Children laughing and galloping along the promenade, caught in colorful reveries unknown to everyone else, all at once one with their surroundings. Parents and caretakers grateful for this amorphous thief of attention. College students smiling and bright and young and beautiful, their minds and bodies not yet touched by the tribulations of taxes and to-do lists. A man gazing across the lake, contemplating something more than the shape of his loneliness. On the field a woman who knows there are stars exhaling their final breath behind cold clouds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hang onto the moment and watch it fade like snow in eager hands. Let it go and let it come back in due time – or so my therapist tells me it will. But I want to tell someone I caught a snowflake today. I want to say I used my tongue for more than gossip and conviction, that I devoured more than my fair share of the day. Already the trees are losing their pride, standing there and swaying like faceless towers in the distance, reminding me that the invisible hand of consistency bends even the greatest of us. The blades of grass and pebbles of rain take on their usual role. I want to join the runners now, but the stage is set. The dead leaves have fallen and died. I take my place and recite my lines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A self remains when I return back home. He’s waiting for me at the dining table with a hungry look on his face. His friends are there too, ravenous. Where have you been? I welcome them, my family. They want to hear about the tragedies of my day. I tell them the apartment is emptier than it once was, sure. A guitar stand, a bookshelf, a yoga mat. Traces and outlines, stains and eraser shavings occupy me more than they should. Still, I tell them I can work with that. Maybe it’s enough. I steady myself at my desk and sketch a word portrait of the lake. I show them how to turn lightning into thunder.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Dancing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What I do sometimes feels motivated by the desire to feel like I’m &lt;em&gt;improving at&lt;/em&gt; that thing rather than the doing of the thing itself. It’s a form of contextless motivation that is analogous to consuming dating advice without having any skin in the game or learning music theory without ever having strummed a guitar. Living in this way leaves you feeling one-step removed from life, like you’re constantly wrapped up in a condom (lol) when what you really want is contact. You may feel more comfortable and safe, especially if you’re new to the activity, but the deeper learning and improvement happens when you simply let yourself dance, when you aren’t totally concerned with improving or proving yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, I’m not against improving and improvement (and condoms), but historically I’ve been bad at being bad at things. How I typically compensate is by fixating on ways that I can improve. But this can shift the focus away from the activity itself onto something that is pointless on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I went to a salsa dancing class a week ago and was partnered with a more experienced woman at the end of the night. She looked like a regular and presented herself with the relaxed and strong poise of a veteran. I was intimidated to dance with her. Then the music started playing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The beginners I danced with at the start of class went through the learned motions with me. I didn’t know how to lead and they didn’t know how to follow, how to be held and led. We simply moved the way we were taught without any sense of style, sexiness, or connection to the other person. Most of them had left at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the experienced woman, it was a world of difference. Her back was leaned firmly into my right hand the whole time, awaiting any signals I might give her to twist, turn, or do something else entirely. There was an unfamiliar energy between us, a budding tension I didn’t know what to do with given my sparse salsa repertoire consisting only of basic steps, simple turns, and walk throughs. She held her gaze confidently against mine, and her initial smile had transformed into something more serious, something more attuned and present.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She was ready to dance, while I was stuck in practice mode. Instead of tuning into the moment and confidently dancing with the moves I had been taught, I was afraid of letting go, messing up, and looking like a total novice. I wanted to impress and be seen as competent rather than allow myself to groove and sway my hips as I pleased. I was mentally counting my steps – 1, 2, 3… 5, 6, 7… 1, 2, 3… 5, 6, 7 – and remained rooted in my head for most of the song. Even then I still lost track of the rhythm. Even then I still misstepped. Even then I felt like a complete rookie. But when the song was over, she smiled and thanked me for the dance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s human to want to be good at what you do, but to be good one is usually bad at first. This is true of everything you try for the first time, and sometimes even the millionth time. You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t berate or criticize a friend or child for trying something new though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The same can be true for you. Being bad at things induces anxiety in me (it’s probably related to feeling like I have to prove myself for love and approval, or something), but so does a constant focus on whether or not I’m good or am improving at what I’m doing. It’s possible, I think, to be more child-like in my pursuits, to do things without an eye toward constant improvement and comparison. What matters is dancing when the music starts. This is where the joy is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Dear Change</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Change,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m having a really hard time and I’m not sure what to do with myself. I feel like I’m treading underwater. I’ve done so much of that already and still I come up with scraps as to what I need to do about it. The pieces are flimsy and disconnected and I feel aimless in all this uncertainty. As a result I’m thinking about the past a lot. What was, what could have been, ways I could have been better (so many ways god fucking damnit), another chance in the future. I ruminate about my ex-girlfriend and how she is probably doing much better without me, while I’m left feeling stuck. I want to share the rare slices of joy I find throughout my day, like how beautiful the Myrtle Tree outside my parent’s house looks around sunset time every day, the pink flowers full in their lucid bloom. She would have appreciate it from her head to her little toes, the way she always did with what was beautiful. But I can’t do that anymore. She was so good at finding the joy and beauty in things, and I was constantly aimed at the faults and explicating.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m tired and am floating around what looks like a solid rock bottom, that place she must have hit when my selfish, fearful self broke her heart again. The only apology worth having at this point is the one where I become less needy and dependent on others to resolve my personal issues. The one where I am a beacon of joy, inspiration, and light again. It’s terrifying how much shit keeps coming up though, how vampiric and hermetic I can become in my suffering, walking a path that can only be walked by me toward so many unknowns. Maybe I’m being too hard on myself as I tend to be, but man, it feels horrible to see more clearly all the ways I could have been a better partner and friend to others. So much of my identity has been predicated on being the lost and alone kid, the dreamer without any plans or commitments to actualize them. This shows up in what I’ve historically found to be the most meaningful part of connecting with others, that is, over a shared sense of lostness and loneliness. But once people grew and figured out what they wanted to do next, I began to feel abandoned. I began to fear that I would lose them once they saw how little I knew about who I was and what I wanted. What I didn’t see was that this didn’t matter to them. That they loved me just for being me. I was abandoning myself by not joining them, by failing to live out the harder questions that only I could answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what to do other than to write about all of this. Glorified complaining, probably. But not much else comforts me right now, even music. I’m trying new things like salsa dancing, hanging with my parents, yoga and acroyoga, and rock climbing. But at the end of the night, I still feel a lack of direction and purpose in my life, a deep missingness. This is likely due to my lack of deep commitment to something bigger than myself, but the only thing that ever felt close to being right was my relationship, and even that I lost. I’m also losing what I tried to force meaning from, which is my academic career. Deep down I never really felt fulfilled by it, but it was much harder to change and face the questions I have ignored for the bulk of my adulthood than to stay and pretend like I cared the way my peers did. I did care for and am interested in science, but academia just isn’t for me. I could have made it work if I enjoyed the research and knew what the constant struggle was for, but I hadn’t answered that for myself yet. All the running and the ways I’d been depending on others to answer my midlife crises is no longer serving me. It never really has.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do have my passions and interests like writing and playing outside and more recently music and songwriting, but I was never willing to accept the tradeoffs it took to build a life around them, given my amateur abilities and various desires. These activities nurtured my soul but I also wanted to be practical. I wanted to have money but I also hated the idea of just getting a job and compromising! I wanted to be special, and yet I wasn’t willing to grind it out and put in the work. I wanted to grow up without actually growing. This is changing though, slowly. I am putting behind the PhD, despite the small hint of disapproval, confusion, and disappointment by my parents. I’ve applied to jobs that employ many of the tangible skills I’ve learned over the years, some of which I actually enjoy more than I want to admit due to their lack of prestige. I have a fuzzy vision of what I want, which I don’t feel too afraid of pursuing anymore. I am still afraid of the future and committing to things, but the fear and pain of staying put greatly outweighs the discomfort of building a different life and lifestyle. Maybe I’ll throw a pup in the mix somewhere along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I weeped in the car the other day on my way to yoga when I realized that I might be leaving Vermont. It was my first true home away from home. It was where I loved and fell hard in love for the first time. I learned how to slackline and play guitar there. I befriended my dear neighbor and her chickens. I helped build the largest brain study in the US. I don’t know where else I really want to go, but there isn’t much left there for me anymore. The one thing I deeply loved I destroyed. Part of me wants to stay and have the opportunity to make amends, but what might be best for us is if I stop trying to force an outcome. What would be best is if I thought more about the long-term consequences of my actions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was the shy and quiet kid in 1st grade who preferred the brick wall of the school building to the large field where everyone else was playing. It was a big day for me when I decided to get up and join them. The sprint out was full of joy and courage. My back is against the wall again. I am looking for the courage to allow and create more joy for myself and others. Perhaps it has been in and around me this whole time, and I am only now learning how to enjoy it more clearly. I still have my words and so much more that I have yet to see.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Phil&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Growing Pains</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/22-07-31-growing-pains/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since my recent psychedelic trip, I’ve noticed that my emotions and thought patterns have returned to a familiar baseline. I feel just as moody and temperamental as before, though the swings are certainly less erratic. Still, they can hit hard and have destabilized me when my mind wanders too deep into thinking about the future, what I’m working on, who I am, and other similar questions. Put another way, the juicy existential stuff is coming up again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which has me wondering: why? What is triggering these thoughts and the anxiety behind them? What emotional needs of mine are being unmet? It’s possible that all of this is connected to the grief I’m going through regarding the end of my relationship, which I’m constantly missing and thinking about (the first love cuts the deepest, right?). But I’ve felt a vague sense of dissatisfaction and missingness for years now. Writing and talking about it helps, but it feels like I’m running through a mental maze I know too well, performing the same outdated emotional gymnastics in an attempt to hold together a life that is yearning for more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A part of me is okay with all of this. I feel less anxious overall, and it’s easier to step back and make space for the moments of unease, for the duality of contradictory emotions that can emerge and coexist in a single body. Yet another part of me continues to reach. It doesn’t want distance and uncertainty anymore. It wants to close the gap between ideal and reality, something I have struggled to contend with as an adult and dreamy optimist. How do we know when it is our ideals or our realities that are in need of an update?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s true that the PhD rarely fulfills me (I need to dig into this) and has made me a bit cynical about science, but the concrete pieces of the work keep me grounded and engaged with others. Maybe it’s not supposed to entirely fulfill me. What I might need is to slow down and observe, to come home to my body, tune into the rhythms of my days, and pay off the lingering soul-debt. Maybe I simply need to read more, make more friends and deepen the friendships I already have, be outside in the sun, write occasionally, and pursue at my own pace whatever catches my curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have no clues or answers to the questions that accompany me. I’m in the dark again. Though what I’ve witnessed over and over is that there is an inextinguishable essence or soul that readily shows itself in the process of grieving and healing. Even in the most painful of moments, it reassures you that you will make it to the other side. It reminds you that it was forged in the heat of heartbreak and loss, and can stand in the face of anything life throws at you. And when you’re ready to be taken by the flame of passion and desire again, it will be there with you waiting to heed the call.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;David Whyte, from Consolations:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pain is the doorway to the here and now. Physical or emotional pain is an ultimate form of ground, saying, to each of us, in effect, there is no other place than this place, no other body than this body, no other limb or joint or pang or sharpness or heartbreak but this searing presence. Pain asks us to heal by focusing not only on the place the pain is felt but also the actual way the pain is felt. Pain is a form of alertness and particularity; pain is a way in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, pain is appreciation; for most of all the simple possibility and gift of a pain-free life – all the rest is a bonus. Others do not know the gift in simply being healthy, of being unconsciously free to move or walk or run. Pain is a lonely road, no one can know the measure of our particular agonies, but through pain we have the possibility, just the possibility, of coming to know others as we have, with so much difficulty, come to know ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;</description>

Something fun to note: The Webb telescope is so sensitive that it can detect the heat signature of a bumblebee at the distance of the Moon (from Earth), and can see details the size of a US penny at the distance of about 25 miles or 40 kilometers!&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The past six months have been covered by a dark, oppressive cloud that made me doubt if I would ever feel good again. I sometimes wondered if life was worth living, and though I quickly extinguished these kinds of thoughts, I had lost faith in my ability to understand how I felt and what I needed to move myself forward. I hated being alone but couldn’t enjoy the company of others. Crying spells came over me at random times throughout the day. Nights were unbearably restless. I felt stuck and lifeless, like a ship without a sail.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately I’m now starting to come out of it, in no small part thanks to the help of psychedelics. This was my second time taking them (I wrote about my first time &lt;a href=&#34;https://philintheblank.me/posts/trippy/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) which I approached with three specific intentions: 1) to let go of the shame and feeling of being a failure associated with the end of my relationship, 2) to reflect on my career and desires, and 3) to feel more in touch with life again. I had done a lot of inner work and received an absurd amount of help from family and friends (thank you guys) prior to taking them, though they certainly enhanced and accelerated the healing process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rest of this post will highlight parts of the experience and insights (that I remember) I had that seemed to have led me to a better state of mind. It will be more personal and anecdotal since others have already written about the potential benefits and reasons as to why you might want to embark on a similar journey. Disclaimer: I’m only a doctor-in-training, and not the kind that can credibly prescribe medical advice lol. I am in no way suggesting that anyone reading this should use psychedelics for any reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I woke up early and started the morning with a short stroll around the block to solidify my intentions. Two grams of psilocybin were waiting for me upon my return home. I wasn’t sure what to expect from the trip, but I knew it was important to be open to whatever came up during the experience. Still, a part of me was hanging onto the hope that I would be granted specifically what I asked for: more clarity and a renewed license on life. When the clock struck seven, I lit a candle and began the journey.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There was nothing for the first hour. No changes in perception, no notable differences in the order and ordinariness of my living room. Then I started feeling irritated. I also noticed the presence of a heavy weight hanging over my head. I wasn’t sure if this was my mind attempting to keep itself intact while being unraveled by the psilocybin, or something else, but I leaned further into it. Slowly my mind states felt less discrete. I became less inhibited as the boundary between the world and my sense of self loosened. Time was losing its grip over reality, and moments started merging together like a continuous fluid I was no longer separate from.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At one point I picked up my guitar and tried playing a song I knew, but I couldn’t get past the first chord. Each note reverberated with an overwhelming beauty and multitude of meanings that filled every inch of body and left me dumbstruck. Music is so fucking beautiful! It wasn’t long before my mind went down the rabbit hole of other seemingly unrelated thoughts. There was less a sense of control over myself, but I didn’t feel afraid. I wanted to be carried down the current and see what wanted to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I thought about consciousness and the many layers of story we choose and don’t choose to live by, how they sometimes prevent us from doing certain things and push us toward others, how flexible and amenable they are to change, all while witnessing the recursive and layered nature of self and identity. One moment I would be laughing wildly, the next crying like a helpless infant, though again, the moments didn’t really feel like moments at this point. Thoughts, feelings, and emotions flowed through me the way water does when rushing past stones in a river. There was the constant urge to sense-make, to grasp and understand what by nature never could be. I thought about how absurd we are at times, how absurd society is, how absurd it is that we believe we know anything with certainty. Everything felt connected and meaningful. And then it didn’t. And then it did again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later I arrived at thoughts of my relationship. Living in my chest was a sense of being a failure and the fear of failing again in the future. There was a lot of shame too in how things ended, in how I couldn’t overcome myself to keep what should have been enough. I had to keep trying I thought, and in a way I was still trying to make things work for me. I reached out to hold these emotions and began to forgive myself. I recognized that I had tried my best and acknowledged how much pain I was in from trying to prevent the ship from sinking. Waves of ecstasy and sorrow moved through me as I rummaged through old photos, loving text messages, thoughtful memorabilia I had received throughout our relationship. Everything was a reminder of the love that existed and was created by us. There was so much of that, so much love.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also saw that we were propelled by dreams and fantasies that were beyond our reach. Getting married. Coming home to the safety of each other at the end of the day. Having kids and spending our days learning together. Sharing a quiet life full of our perfectly boring and specific kind of fun and love. It was excruciating to see their beauty, and to let them go. (Writing about them now, I continue to feel their pains echoing across my body, though it’s much less intense than the previous months.) The reality was that something consistently felt off for me, and not listening to that feeling made the relationship more difficult than it had to be. That I could see and was beginning to finally accept. I wanted the love to be enough, but it wasn’t able to bridge our dreams to something more real. What was real was that something wasn’t working for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I cried on my couch for the next hour, then laid there with a sleeping mask over my eyes. Colorful geometric patterns with fractal-like structures pulsed in and out of the darkness in a dance with my fleeting feelings and fragmented thoughts. Nothing was really coherent at this point, but the visions induced an unspeakable awe in me. I remember seeing a constellation of bright lights in the center of my mind that put me in a religious trance. It looked like a small cloud or series of sunbeams piercing the void of space, a little bit like the album cover of “Make Yourself” by Incubus. I felt at peace and felt that life was going to be okay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some time later, as my mind slowly pieced itself together, I made my way to the kitchen to eat leftover tortilla chips. It was difficult to walk because my sense of myself in space and my connection to my body was still somewhat severed. But I got to the counter soon enough and gathered my delectables. It took several minutes to put one chip in my mouth because I was stupidly astonished by the damn thing. How it was made, its intricate shape, the way it felt between my fingers, the joy it brought to so many people – I was on the verge of tears again. And then I ate it. What followed was virtually an orgasm – a foodgasm. My whole body shook with delight each time my tongue made contact with the chip and tasted what was the golden ratio of salt and lime. Chewing and swallowing was clunky and unappealing like my walk into the kitchen, but still, it was the best damn chip I had ever eaten in my life. Eating is so fucking sensual! I said to myself. (Thinking about the experience now is kinda turning me on lol)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I felt more grounded, I went outside and walked downtown toward the lake. There was a lightness in my step and an unfamiliar confidence in the way that I carried myself. I felt less self-centered. My attention was more easily captured by what was happening around me rather than the content of my own thoughts. Everything was fun to look at: flowers, clouds, worms crawling on the ground, porches, sidewalks, people. Who knew it could be so fun to look at the world? I, Mr. budding writer, supposedly did, but I had forgotten how pleasurable it was to give something my fullest attention – no, rather, to have it be completely seized by something beyond myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I loved noticing my attention shift from an intensely focused microscope to a softer panoramic view. I couldn’t contain my smile and constantly had the urge to laugh. That was funny to notice: the desire to suppress my emotions in order to come off a certain way. I went to a bookstore to test the state of my cognition, which I found was highly functional if I tried hard enough to read the book I was holding. A computational psychiatry book held my interest for some time, though I grew bored of it pretty quickly. Nothing else in the store really caught my eye either. My motivation to read and tendency toward abstraction had become less existent. All I wanted to do was walk around, look, and experience the moment firsthand. Nothing felt as interesting as what I could perceive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend and I broke up five months ago, but we had continued to try to make things work until very recently. A part of me had wanted the trip to bring us back together, to bring me to a place where I had found a way to keep the relationship alive. But it only showed me more clearly that I had to let her go. I wasn’t anxious about it anymore, just sad, which is perhaps the best state to be in given the circumstances. I still think of her and feel lonely at times, but I know that my letting go came from a place of total acceptance. I have an unwavering faith in that wherever life takes us, it will be a better place. I’m also certain that this was the most loving thing to do, for her and myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m returning to a certain mood baseline already, which was to be expected, but I also seem more able to trust my instincts. Old compulsions and lackluster habits don’t have as much gravity anymore. The urge to control my experience has been reduced. I feel comfortable in my body again, and there’s more lightness and joy when I go about my day. I feel more content to be who I already am, which is much better than only believing that you are. I find myself quite charming and funny. It’s easier to smile and laugh. I still have my moments when I’m wrapped up in thought, but letting them go comes more effortlessly when the moment warrants it. My emotions are less turbulent, more consistently happy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People who know me would say that I was already a happy, optimistic, and care-free person. What they didn’t see was that so much of my existence was also riddled by incessant self-doubt and worry. I never had the sense that I was doing anything right with my life, hence the fear of failure and associated shame with regard to my relationships, my winding career trajectory, and my creative pursuits. They always recognized the potential in me and tried to nurture and encourage it, but I never felt like I was good enough. I never felt like I was enough, not in a viscerally manner anyways. I fully recognize this now and feel confident that I can catch myself if I fall back into the depths of these thought patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for my career and desires, I don’t see myself hopping out of the PhD quite yet, or at least I don’t feel as bad about doing it as I did before. It feels more like a job that neatly fits where I’m at in life than a crucial part of my identity and happiness. I also want to write more and focus on honing my creativity. I used to think that my craft was specifically writing, but I’m seeing now that maybe it’s about expression and learning more generally. In my high school years I enjoyed writing guides, coaching newb League of Legends players, streaming my gameplay, and making YouTube videos with my online friends. Later I learned how to code and build websites, math and statistics, and how to grasp the gestalt of difficult subjects. As long as I’m learning and making things that affect even one person, I think I’ll be pretty content. This is something I want to explore more across multiple mediums.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It will never cease to amaze me that a compound like psilocybin can produce so much clarity, insight, and joy. Obviously I still need to go about living my days and engaging with the world, which is the true testing ground. But I feel all the more prepared for it. The fear of losing the confidence and lightness is real, but I’m guessing that as long as I stay and act within the vicinity of my desires, life will continue to feel good. It’s possible too that at least some of these changes will be more or less permanent. If not, I may have to take the word of my therapist, who cutely said that “people should do psychedelics every six months”, and see again what lies both within and beyond the universe of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>I Wanna Be</title>

      <pubDate>Sun, 10 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/22-07-10-i_wanna_be/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb795e1e1-8f8b-4c93-84dd-e16dfd6f6c11_720x960.png&#34; alt=&#34;From a recent hike.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently rewatched some old videos I had made back in my gaming days. (WoW &amp;amp; LoL anyone?) They reminded me of how obsessed I was with being the best, and how good I actually was, which wasn’t half-bad by most accounts. I was never quite the best, but it was enough for me to play with and be among them. That was all I really needed in life to be happy, the opportunity to keep playing the game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many years later, my preferences have remained mostly the same. I stopped playing video games in the hardcore manner of my adolescence, though I still gravitate toward activities that provide clear and immediate feedback like slacklining and practicing guitar. This makes writing and academic research difficult for me at times due to the implicit uncertainty and lack of encouraging signals, but I’m learning how to manage my energy and mind as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What helps is knowing that I’m participating in a longer-term game. The goal isn’t to win, but to keep playing for as long as we can or want to. It’s easier to do so when the game is aligned with our core values and brings us a sense of fulfillment when we reflect on the ‘why’ of it all. But even then the doubts inevitably come from time to time, causing us to question our motivations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a shift is warranted and you move on and play something else. But how do you know when it’s time to make the leap? Many things in my life currently feel up in the air, which makes it hard to be present and happy in its perpetual, recursive unfolding. I’m thinking about my relationships, my career, the role of writing in my life and why I continue to labor over words and voice and style when so many other forces are demanding my attention. So it warmed my soul when my friend sent me the the message below:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I lost my maternal grandmother last Friday. Am still processing and grieving. Just wanted to tell you that I’ve been reading “My Light” from Seeds and it has helped me tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In finding reassurance and meaning in a poem I wrote awhile ago, she helped me see that my words and work mean something. That art, no matter how seemingly insignificant, has the power to help us see more clearly and heal. This was the reassurance and validation I needed to continue making things I may not see the impact of for years, if ever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wish I was purely motivated by enjoyment and curiosity in my pursuits, but it’s not as simple as that for me. I need more reassurance than I’m comfortable admitting. It gives my existence an extra layer of meaning to latch onto during hard times. Maybe I’ll never be the best at accepting it and many other things in my life, but I’m certainly trying. This puts me in the grace of the best company while still keeping me in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;links-music-miscellanea&#34;&gt;Links, Music, Miscellanea&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chess and Cognition.&lt;/strong&gt; Below is a Twitter thread highlighting some research findings that suggest learning chess (and music and languages) has no &amp;ldquo;cognitive transfer&amp;rdquo; effects. That is, knowledge is domain-specific and being good at chess doesn&amp;rsquo;t make you better at math (and other intellectual pursuits). This makes me think about parents who force their kids to learn things as means to other ends, usually in the service of academic performance and college applications, which makes me a bit sad. (&lt;em&gt;cough&lt;/em&gt; Many Asian parents amirite?) Maybe it’s well-intentioned, but the unintended consequence tends to be that these kids end up hating what could have been enjoyed for enjoyment’s sake. Rather than encourage and nurture their natural curiosities, parents push them – sometimes forcefully – to do &lt;em&gt;extracurriculars&lt;/em&gt; in service of achievement. Not every parent does this of course, and I’m certainly not saying that we should never push kids towards certain activities – I’m sure all of this has been extensively studied elsewhere – but these findings suggest that maybe we should chill out a bit with our cultural utilitarianism and do things for the sake of doing them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Previous studies suggested that teaching kids chess improved a range of outcomes, from math skills to logic to academics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But it just isn’t true. Now, two large randomized trials, one in the UK &amp;amp; one in Bangladesh found no other benefits to learning chess.

Personally I&amp;rsquo;ve been meditating less over the years, not directly as a consequence of anything the author mentioned, but more out of an intuition that it really wasn&amp;rsquo;t helping me in the way I thought it would. I used it as a panacea of sorts for my personal issues, which ultimately turned it into an attempt to control and distance myself from myself. It can help you see your issues more clearly – and certainly manage them – but it doesn’t directly address the root cause of what may be bothering you. To be clear, I’m not bashing mindfulness meditation in any way. Just don’t overfit the practice and expect it to solve all your problems. On that note, here’s a study suggesting that an 8-week mindfulness-based meditation program produced no structural changes in the brains of the participants. Some people may take this as evidence not to meditate. But the reason you might want to do so isn’t for the brain changes. It’s, in part at least, to reap the benefits at an experiential level. Whether or not it leads to brain differences is besides the point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FKJ Tiny Desk Concert.&lt;/strong&gt; Funky. Playful.

      <title>Chaos</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/frac.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Photo by Seyed Ahmadreza Abedi.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m fascinated by the idea that seemingly small choices can have profound and unpredictable effects on the state of the future. In the study of dynamical systems, this is characterized as the phenomenon of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDek6cYijxI&#34;&gt;chaos&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine we had a single equation that could perfectly predict how the universe would unfold for all of time. All it would need to work is a set of inputs – i.e. the initial conditions, in the parlance of mathematics – that described the current state of the universe. Feed the equation variables like number of living stars, the density of every known planet, the emotional state of all sentient beings, and anything else we can measure, in return for a singular expression that contained everything everywhere all at once.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Except that, even with the God equation, our predictions would fall short due to the imperfect precision of our measurements. We would also need the hand and ruler of God in our attempts at total certainty. But even then there are infinities that are, mathematically speaking, bigger than others, a strange truism that ultimately undermines our measurement efforts. What we actually get for all our counting and sizing up of things are outlines, a general arc but not the arc itself, in the limit of time. We gain insight into how the future might turn out, but looking more closely at the system gives us no further clarity on the true state of universal affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7af2ebf-23a8-47a3-a927-9ba9cf46534d_2560x1920.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;The Mandelbrot set. Zoom in and look more closely – make more precise measurements – and you will continue to find more of the same. Photo source: Wikipedia.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We never really questioned if the equations themselves were dynamic in my dynamical systems class. We just assumed that our expressions captured the important aspects of the systems we sought to describe. But what if what was important could change and therefore elude the mathematical cages we had constructed? Chaos is not the same as randomness, which is surely a feature of the universe. The equations we had didn’t account for that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Saturday afternoon. I’ve just finished reading a chapter from a statistics text on p-values. It’s the fiftieth time I’ve had to familiarize myself again with the concept and its pitfalls, though I could be doing much worse things in science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I leave the bookstore with three books in tow. The sun is beaming through clouded skies, leaving me under hails of light that pattern the sidewalk in a dance with the trees. Five pages into &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.richardpowers.net/bewilderment/&#34;&gt;Bewilderment&lt;/a&gt;, I’m holding back tears on an empty park bench.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Watching medicine fail my child, I developed a crackpot theory: Life is something we need to stop correcting. My boy was a pocket universe I could never hope to fathom. Every one of us is an experiment, and we don’t even know what the experiment is testing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My wife would have known how to talk to the doctors. Nobody’s perfect, she liked to say. But, man, we all fall short so beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What we know is a game of numbers in the mind of many scientists. The more experiments we run, the more certain we can be of our results. But no two experiments are exactly the same, surely a confound in this line of thinking. Let time take care of the uncertainty, they say, to which I respond: we will all be dead in the limit of time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Have I played the game long enough to know if I am different now in comparison to all previous versions of myself? Would a within-subject null hypothesis test yield a statistically significant p-value? Or is this a false positive, a random fluctuation in the data collection process that has led me to an erroneous conclusion about how I feel?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People and cars are blurring past me. Behind me there is music. Birds are singing, when I listen closely enough to hear them. I put on my sunglasses, close my eyes, and let the world in. The tears begin to fall, a lightness fills my chest. I lean and zoom into the moment, not to predict or control the future, but to know the meaning of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;links-music-miscellanea&#34;&gt;Links, Music, Miscellanea&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ankit.fyi/being-alone&#34;&gt;Being Alone&lt;/a&gt;. An essay on being alone as a portal toward building the relationship you have with yourself. I liked it because it didn’t treat aloneness as an end in and of itself, but rather as a way to get more comfortable in your own skin. This was a much needed read because loneliness has felt more poignant lately. Accepting it and focusing on rediscovering and creating my own joy, I’m starting to feel good in it again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I loved this recent piece Ava the great Bookbear wrote, &lt;a href=&#34;https://ava.substack.com/p/what-we-find-in-other-people&#34;&gt;what we find in other people&lt;/a&gt;. What really resonated with me was this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The way I used to relate to people was so much about completion, about craving. I didn’t understand that you can never get enough of something you don’t really need. If you’re blind to the wholeness that’s already present, you’ll never find it in other people. &lt;strong&gt;When you see it you’ll see it in everyone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m still constantly learning how to see this in others and myself, the undeniable wholeness that already exists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I rediscovered Masaaki Kishibe recently, an acoustic guitarist and composer from Japan. He has a distinct, lulling sound to his compositions. I’m learning this song in particular, Light:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/b3b6xocBqUo&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/slacklining.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Photo by Sean Benesh.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prior to publishing this I caught a whiff of my inner critic and felt some harshness toward myself. It amazes me how hard I can be on myself sometimes. I’m trying to (gently) change that. A little reminder then:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Without diving into the strangeness of self-worth as a concept we tout, know that your self-worth is not contingent on what you publish or its quality. Writing is simply something you like to do and share! Give that inner critic a long hug and tell him you don’t have to prove yourself to anyone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I went slacklining the other day despite not really feeling up for it. I had learned everything I wanted to learn the previous year (minus the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0xGhtvl85s&#34;&gt;butt bounce&lt;/a&gt;), so I thought it wouldn’t be fun unless I was improving at something. I’m not sure when I developed this attitude – it probably has roots in my hardcore gaming days – but I went ahead anyways and had a great time. The bike ride to my usual spot by the lake, the cottonwood seeds floating along weightlessly under the clear blue skies, everything culminated to the gift of a perfect summer day. I didn’t have to try too hard to drop my attachment to the feeling of progress. I just had to get up on the line and walk. The rest simply followed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did learn something too: when two opposing forces meet, there exists the possibility for a perfect kind of harmony to emerge. It rears its head at the point of criticality between stable and unstable, at the moment right before a system splits into multiple modes of being, right when your body and gravity conspire to kiss the resistance of the slackline in a dance for equilibrium. If you aren’t fully present you’ll topple over. But maintain the juxtaposition and something beautiful happens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;gsd&#34;&gt;GSD&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding my research, I’ve been digging into ideas that fall under the philosophy of science umbrella. Things like measurement, what it means to study something like resilience and depression, and so on. None of it has directly moved any projects forward (I’m still scrounging around for one…), but these are important issues that ultimately influence how science is done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, in depression research it’s common practice to add up self-reported symptom scores when attempting to determine whether or not someone has depression. If their score is above a certain number (a threshold value), they are then classified as depressed. In clinical studies, this is done so that you know whether or not an intervention worked. If their total depression score falls below the threshold value after taking an antidepressant for three weeks, say, then the antidepressant works – eureka! (Barring any issues with the experimental design, analyses, and so forth, of course.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This seems well and good, but what does this change in total depression score really mean? In what ways does it reflect a qualitative difference in a person’s subjective experience, if at all? When researchers add up symptom scores like this, they are assuming that the difference between a total score of 9 and 11 is the same as the difference between a total score of 13 and 15, which may not be the case. Additionally, symptoms such as ‘loss of appetite’ and ‘decreased mood’ are treated equally in this sum score approach to depression, another assumption that seems questionable to myself and people more experienced than me to talk about this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;🔥 Folks—there&amp;#39;s a new paper in town, and I&amp;#39;d love to tell you about it. In the paper I wrote with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/JkayFlake?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@JkayFlake&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; Don Robinaugh, we take a bird&amp;#39;s eye view on depression measurement. History, present, future. In particular, we discuss shaky theoretical &amp;amp; methodological foundations🧵&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Eiko Fried (@EikoFried) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/EikoFried/status/1516413962027515909?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;April 19, 2022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of this is interesting – and frustrating – to think about. You can get lost in the weeds and grow cynical towards science as a result because you still have to ‘Get Shit Done’ (phrase credited to the postdoc researcher I’ve started meeting weekly) with imperfect and imprecise definitions and measurements. You still have to churn out academic papers and make scientific progress in the name of ‘progress’. But without a &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09637214221096485&#34;&gt;solid conceptual grasp&lt;/a&gt; of what we mean when we study depression or anything else, is science really making any progress? &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/22/us/thomas-insel-book.html&#34;&gt;Is it helping&lt;/a&gt; the people it purports to be helping?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;links-music-miscellanea&#34;&gt;Links, Music Miscellanea&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Article: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/therapy-mental-health-extremely-online/&#34;&gt;Therapists Should Build a New Cultural Competence: ‘Onlineness’.&lt;/a&gt; A fun read on “onlineness” as a cultural competency that therapists might want to develop. The internet is home to many forms of culture and subculture that influence our beliefs, how we perceive ourselves, and how we act. I’m curious about what cultural competency in ‘onlineness’ would look like given its vastness. Would we have therapists who are culturally specialized in Twitter discourse? De-radicalization of online extremists? The hardships of growing a Substack readership? One thing that seems clear is that we are creatures of context. To help ourselves and others, we need an understanding of that context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Article: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/fiction-in-the-age-of-screens&#34;&gt;Fiction in the Age of Screens.&lt;/a&gt; I loved this piece. TV and other forms of media entertainment are becoming increasingly dominant in the stratosphere of culture while the humble ol’ book has remained pretty much the same. What is its place in such a world, specifically fiction writing? The answer, according to Hoel, is about consciousness and the interiority of others. No other medium comes close in giving us a portal into what it’s like to be you or I:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;…writers in their craft do something unique: they take the intrinsic perspective on the world. Reading fiction allows you to witness the world of consciousness that normally hides beneath the scientifically describable, physically modelable surface-world of appearances. From the intrinsic perspective of a novel, the reader can finally observe other selves as they really are, as complicated collections of both third-person and first-person facts. Doing so would normally violate all kinds of epistemological rules: from the extrinsic world you can infer but can’t directly know someone’s sensations and thoughts, not the way you directly know your own experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given its very nature, the novel cannot help but stand in cultural opposition to extrinsic drift. For the novel is the only medium in which the fundamental unit of analysis is the interiority of a human life. It opposes the unwarranted privileging of the extrinsic half of the world over the intrinsic. It is a reminder, a sign in the desert that seems to be pointing nowhere until its flickering neon lettering is read: There is something it is like to be a human being. And what it is like matters. The sign points to what cannot be seen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is something it is like to be a human being. And &lt;strong&gt;what it is like&lt;/strong&gt; matters.&lt;/em&gt; I got goosebumps reading that line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Music: primeiro verão – Lilian Pinto.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/M0MrgXqat5k&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Video: &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/31158841&#34;&gt;Murmuration&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=&#34;https://cssociety.org/about-us/what-are-cs&#34;&gt;the study of Complex Systems&lt;/a&gt;, there is a concept called &lt;a href=&#34;https://theconversation.com/emergence-the-remarkable-simplicity-of-complexity-30973&#34;&gt;emergence&lt;/a&gt; which “describes the ability of individual components of a large system to work together to give rise to dramatic and diverse behavior” – the whole is more than the sum of its parts, in other words. You see this happening in the video below, the whole being the collective behavior of the starlings. On their own they behave as we might expect of individual birds. Together, something more beautiful emerges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;iframe title=&#34;vimeo-player&#34; src=&#34;https://player.vimeo.com/video/31158841?h=53552f5cc3&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Something New</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/22-06-19-something_new/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/22-06-19-something_new/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/finding-direction.webp&#34; alt=&#34;A poem I received while in Washington DC. I told the poet I was searching for direction, and this is what he gave me.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been beating myself up over the fact that I’m not writing as much. Or rather, that I’m not writing anything I deem worth publishing. I still journal and scrap together the occasional poem, though most of it sits in draft form. My priorities are different these days, which I’m continually adjusting to. I’m focused on my finding my stride in academic research, improving my guitar skills, and generally maintaining my health and sanity after a grueling succession of months in the first half of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, I want to make room for words and get in the habit of publishing something. This means I need to shift my expectations regarding what I write and the form it takes. I’ve always had obsessive and perfectionistic tendencies when it comes to my writing. It’s a deadly cocktail of traits that when left unchecked can crush the creative soul.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I want to commit to then is writing brief weekly reflections that have the feel of something a little unfinished. I want to also include links to articles I found interesting, music and poems I enjoyed, and other miscellaneous findings from my ongoing webcrawls. Think charcuterie board of assorted thoughts rather than a full five-course meal. The goal is to develop a ritual and space where I can reflect on my weeks without constraining myself to a particular form like a long-form essay (although those may naturally appear in the process of creating these).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Writing more doesn’t require that I publish anything, but it serves as a conduit that focuses my efforts. Of course, I still want to write BEAUTIFUL, EVOCATIVE, POETIC works (by my standard, which isn’t saying much heh) that make people feel all the undefined emotional tingles inside. For now though I’m happy to work with a different set of intentions as I continue to reorient my internal compass.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I’m trying to say is: I’m beginning to internalize that how I live the rest of my life is up to me. I’ve always known this at an intellectual level – as most of us do – but only recently has it started to become a visceral truth, something I can taste in my mouth every morning when I wake up. More on this in a future weekly, but the implication is that if I want to get anything done, I need to set aside time to make things happen. I need to understand what my needs and limits are so that I can work with them in the service of what I want.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The life we want isn’t going to be handed to us on a silver platter. It requires work, the only kind worth doing. Maybe these are obvious points, though putting them into action requires a certain discipline. It might mean getting up at 5am every day so that you can pay your soul its dues. Or forgoing nightly socials in favor of watching guitar tutorials on YouTube. Or running like your life depended on it (for Murakami it did). But once you get going it’s easier to reach escape velocity. You move beyond yourself so that you can see your self more clearly and how it is woven within the threads of an ever-changing context. From there, anything is possible. Murakami:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when I think of life, I feel like a piece of driftwood washed up on shore.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m curious where the tide will take me, and how well I will surf the waves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;reads-music-miscellanea&#34;&gt;Reads, Music, Miscellanea&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://alicegribbin.substack.com/p/the-empathy-racket&#34;&gt;The Empathy Racket.&lt;/a&gt; On the dangers of art as a utilitarian tool. Will be of interest if you’ve ever been curious about what art is, the “role” of art in society, utilitarianism, and the history of empathy:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We each have a spirit life that does not heed society. Our spirit lives rear up out of the unconscious at all the most intense moments in our existence: during sex, meditation, and illness; when dreaming, in danger, and falling in love; through encounters with great art. Artworks speak to us in their own registers. It is on us to cultivate the many ways we can respond.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sunset.com/travel/anne-lamott-how-to-find-time&#34;&gt;Time Lost and Found.&lt;/a&gt; Aimed at writers and creatives more generally, but the overall message rings true for anyone seeking to nourish their innermost desires, to live a fuller life:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They look at me bitterly now—they don’t think I understand. But I do—I know how addictive busyness and mania are. But I ask them whether, if their children grow up to become adults who spend this one precious life in a spin of multitasking, stress, and achievement, and then work out four times a week, will they be pleased that their kids also pursued this kind of whirlwind life?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If not, if they want much more for their kids, lives well spent in hard work and savoring all that is lovely, why are they living this manic way?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.harukimurakami.com/book/what-i-talk-about-when-i-talk-about-running-a-memoir&#34;&gt;What I Talk About When I Talk About Running.&lt;/a&gt; I love peering into the minds of others, especially strange and creative people. If you’ve read anything by Murakami, you’d think he fits the bill for both. But in WITAWITAR he seems pretty ordinary actually, boring even. That doesn’t make him any less prolific or interesting though. I think it was reading this memoir that spurred me into taking my writing more seriously, beginning with simply setting aside time every morning to write before doing my academic work. He might also be the reason I’m going to the gym consistently again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In recent years I’ve been obsessed with modern classical musicians like Ludovico Einaudi and Ólafur Arnalds. This is reflected in an analysis I did of my Top 100 Spotify songs over the years. Increases in acousticness and instrumentalness, down in speechiness and danceability (don’t worry I still love to dance). This fits my love of playing fingerstyle and acoustic guitar too. Signs that I’m getting older lol, maybe. Or that I’m realizing words are not always needed to convey emotion and beauty. Anyways, here’s a song I’ve loved this week:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TbrrVGvgKi8&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Breaking</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/breaking/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There it is again, the widening aperture of a life revealed in hazy hindsight. I’m at the forefront of something new, though what it is I don’t quite know yet. There are people and pages, expression and music, striving and love – but no faces and words, no fingers and guitar strings, no lips and ravenous souls fighting against the tsunami of consummation. My safe space is here in the abstract, but what I want is gravel and blood. A hand around a rainbow-striped waistband, a sulky midnight whisper, the shy thrumming of unkempt desire. Am I running from what I already have, or am I seeing something I didn’t see before? Is this what will save me?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I must have wanted to leave. I must have wanted to change. I must have wanted to let go and let in what I have now. I must have wanted a clarity that continues to elude me, the kind you always had. There was always your lighthouse and its beacon revealing me in the dark. I wanted to hold the light and find my way back to you and reclaim what was ours, but my ship had already strayed too far from shore. You wanted to guide me back, and I wanted to follow, to anchor myself in the love of your harbor, but the ghosts that haunted me beckoned me to go.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to remember everything you taught me, contain everything you ever gave me, but I know that my attempts are trailed by the shifting shadow of memory. Every thought of you changes you, reshapes you, weathers the delicate chrysalis of our temporary crossing. You’re dancing in and out of view in the fulcrum of my mind’s eye, you a silhouette in a house of mirrors. I look at my calendar and see our imagined garden. I hear Claire de Lune and find myself in your living room. I walk my laps around the lake, every sign a sign of you, and remember warmth. Every morning I wake up, I’m reminded of what a dream is. The details are missing, but there again is the blanket of your acceptance. Transience is the joker of the universe, unwanted yet always in the cards we are dealt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know it would be so hard. I didn’t know it would hurt so much, the thundering of two hearts breaking and finding their way again in this world. I hope it hurt me more than all the ways I had hurt you, because I can live with hurting myself. I loved you as best as I could given what I knew and who I was. It wasn’t enough to save us, but every ounce of it was honest and real. You made more room in my heart than I thought was possible, and now I am planting seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope you can forgive me while I work. I hope your anger and sorrow is accompanied by love and tenderness. I am in the process of weaving meaning through the cracks, of letting my heart speak and find voice, of making space for light and shadow to coexist. I wasn’t ever sure of what I wanted, but now I know. I am crystallizing every last fallen tear so that future me will never forget.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>The Booth</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Nice to see you again. What’s on your mind?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“The weeks feel like hours. Hours of searching in mathematical and existential realms, interspersed with little moments of joy when I remember to pay closer attention. Music and line breaks and the rare sentence still give me pause, though they seem rarer in occasion. My eyesight has gone to hell, and my fingers no longer serve me. What happened to the remainder of the weeks? Surely there was more. I’m losing my mind here.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Say more.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“This is what it feels like to get older. A constant yearning for the past, for comfort in nostalgia and reminiscences, for something akin to meaning amidst the moving mirage of memory. The idea of God is suddenly appealing to me despite my lifelong aversion to authoritarian absolutes, another sign of mental decay. Perhaps what I really want is the community on offer.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Do you want an escape?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“No. On the contrary, I want to be engaged. But it feels like there is less of that to look forward to. I’ve look forward all my life, and now there is only darkness. My friends are dead, my wife is gone, and the kids don’t visit anymore. Some poor lady has to wipe my ass every time I take a shit.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Bet that feels nice,” she smirks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Sure, if I could still feel down there. She’s the one having all the fun, and I’m left sitting like a dunce.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“At least she’s kind.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Funny isn’t it? People can spend their entire lives working towards every imaginable thing except for the thing that they really want. They delude and submit themselves into liking things they don’t like, into doing things that crush their soul. Just look at the rampant alcohol consumption and the various degrees of escapism. People want to forget about their lives, not live it. And before they know it they’re on their deathbeds searching for lost time.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Is that true for you? And that’s great novel, Searching for Lost Time.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think so. I mean, my work has really made an impact. I’ve been in love and had great loves from poetry and music to philosophy and mathematics. And no offense, but Proust just isn’t my kind of guy. The sentences – too long and flowery.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“It’s my job not to be offended.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“So what do I do? I can’t go back to work, I can’t bring the dead back to life, I can’t even wipe my ass.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“What do you want?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“What. Do. You. Want?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“What’s the point if there isn’t any future to look forward to? There is so little time.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Maybe the trick is to stop counting.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“That’s a lifetime of therapy honey, and I ain’t got much of that left.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Well, there is this. What do you want, right now? Tell me the first thing that pops into your head.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Sigh. I want to get drunk with the holiest priest in the country so that he will admit to his various affairs.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Go on.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I want to throw the craziest party known to man within cathedral walls.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Invite me.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I want to kneel before the pulpit every day, not to worship or beg for anyone’s forgiveness – there will be plenty of time for that later – but to create opportunities for the girl behind the piano to flash me a look. A look of possibility. A look of imagination. A shy invitation. A revitalizing desire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want her to take me to that place she goes when she is playing from the heart. To the masses it’s just background noise, gifted fingers at work maybe. But to me, it’s love.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“You want love.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“That depends. What do you mean by love?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Proust had a good answer. Maybe start there.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a philosopher, not an English professor.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Philosophy is everywhere, isn’t it?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I’m tired of thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Don’t think then. Look, and listen. Proust had a lot to show. If not him, this. Because there is still this.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Reflections 2021</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2021/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2021/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Apologies for my late arrival to the reflection party (hellooo? Any stragglers or time travelers still here?).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All things considered, 2021 was one of the most eventful and growth-inducing years I’ve had thus far. A big reason for this was that I got into a committed romantic relationship, one that forced me to reexamine old patterns that were no longer serving me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prior to living in Vermont (4 years ago now), I was incredibly averse to any form of long-term commitment. This was partly due to circumstance – i.e. my many temporary jobs – but it manifested as a fear of settling even when I knew what I liked. I was too preoccupied with questions of who I was and what the best version of my life could be to give what I already had my fullest attention. Only later did I learn that not choosing is itself a pernicious form of commitment, one defined by a lack of substance and definition.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My mind found a billion reasons to quit in the earlier parts of our relationship: your life isn’t stable enough; you don’t know what you want; you’re too different; she’s too needy for you; she doesn’t get you and your weird quirks and passions; PHILIP IF YOU CLOSE THAT DAMN DOOR IT WILL BE THE END OF YOU. It tormented me and led to conflicts between us, holding these thoughts in mind and holding her.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What saved us was that we were committed to staying with the tension. We chose to engage with our problems and insecurities rather than run from them. She often reminded me that the door was always open if I wanted to leave, but it was during one of our later conversations that I felt her words were coming from a place of unconditional acceptance. I felt that she was more concerned about my happiness than the relationship itself, which made me love her even more. She had grown to love me enough to let me go, and I had grown to love her enough to fully commit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s true then: this relationship and my other commitments ended me. There is now more room for the things I thought I wouldn’t or couldn’t be doing: writing, playing guitar, building a relationship, living in one place for longer than a year, learning math and statistics in graduate school, cultivating a joyous mind worth befriending and inhabiting. These are currently the essential ingredients of my days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What hasn’t changed is the aim of viewing myself and life more as a mosaic process and less as a finish line to be crossed. Doing so means forgetting ourselves by deeply connecting with the world. It involves others and hobbies and challenges and meaning and love. It requires devotion and learning how to give closer attention to the minutia of the every day. As you tie together all the small wonderful details into the story of your life, you may discover that there is so much more than enough for a lifetime, so much more that matters than you or I.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;some-memorable-memories&#34;&gt;Some Memorable Memories&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interviewing my parents about Vietnam and their refugee experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Relearning how to draw for a week.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meeting my girlfriend in a coffee shop on Church St (Black Cap).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Teaching my girlfriend how to slackline on an early summer afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Watching my girlfriend bench press the bar at the gym for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Swing dancing with my girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Virtual dancing with my Neuromatch pod.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kayaking in search of bioluminescence somewhere in Maine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Disconnecting and reconnecting in a treehouse somewhere in New Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Driving my neighbor to Dartmouth hospital and eating Nepalese food after.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Feeding organic lettuce to the same neighbor’s chickens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Seeing my childhood friend get engaged in California.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hosting my sister for her first trip to Burlington.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Winning 2 lbs of chocolate almonds from Principles of Complex Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hanging onto dear life when R pulled out her phone and asked Z to take her eyes off the road “only for 30 seconds” to watch a TikTok video.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Walking by the lake, catching a crystal-clear sunset, eating Dim Sum for dinner with my girlfriend one winter evening, with her at her best: alive, curious, questioning, free.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sharing my poem Hands with Dad, and his response that meant everything to me: “Wow, I am very grateful and glad to have put some impression (ingredients) in your life. You guys are my best reward in life. Thank you son.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;favorites&#34;&gt;Favorites&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;books&#34;&gt;Books&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Already Free by Bruce Tift&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows by John Koenig&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4000 Weeks: Time Management for Mortals by Oliver Burkeman&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These Precious Days by Ann Patchett&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;essays-and-articles&#34;&gt;Essays and Articles&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ava.substack.com/p/seeing-people?s=r&#34;&gt;Seeing People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Seeing frees. So often when we misunderstand people it’s because we’re not willing to look—we’re too busy projecting our own needs and narratives onto them. We make excuses. We ignore the feelings bubbling up within us, the smoke in the sky a sign that something’s not quite right. We give our power away so we avoid the burden of autonomy. Anthony de Mello: See through people. If you see through yourself, you will see through everyone. Then you will love them. Otherwise you spend the whole time grappling with your wrong notions of them, with your illusions that are constantly crashing against reality. If we’re really willing to see people, really willing to know them, then we become truly able to care for them. Because we recognize the ways they’ll let us down and the things about them that will always excite us. We trust that they love us, even if they don’t always know how. We free them from responsibility for our happiness, and in return we gain the ability to take joy in who they are.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://autotranslucence.wordpress.com/2018/03/30/becoming-a-magician/&#34;&gt;Becoming a Magician&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, in short, a helpful strategy for becoming a magician: Surround yourself with people who look like magicians to you. Then imagine yourself as one, older and wiser, in great detail. Imagine yourself as the person you would be afraid to say you want to be out loud to others (because it seems so ridiculously impossible right now). Write it down in great clarity and detail, then forget it. And let the part of your subconscious mind that still remembers lead you to becoming the things you want, and maybe, years later, check if it did.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.naturalism.org/philosophy/death/death-nothingness-and-subjectivity&#34;&gt;Death, Nothingness, and Subjectivity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is possible that this view may make it easier to cope with the prospect of personal extinction, since, if we accept it, we can no longer anticipate being hurled into oblivion, to face the eternal blackness that so unsettled Burgess (and, I suspect, secretly bedevils many atheists and agnostics). We may wear our personalities more lightly, seeing ourselves as simply variations on a theme of subjectivity which is in no danger of being extinguished by our passing. Of course we cannot completely put aside our biologically given aversion to the prospect of death, but we can ask, at its approach, why we are so attached to this context of consciousness. Why, if experience continues anyway, is it so terribly important that it continue within this set of personal characteristics, memories, and body? If we are no longer haunted by nothingness, then dying may seem more like the radical refreshment of subjectivity than its extinction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://danluu.com/look-stupid/&#34;&gt;Willingness to Look Stupid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The benefit from asking a stupid sounding question is small in most particular instances, but the compounding benefit over time is quite large and I&amp;rsquo;ve observed that people who are willing to ask dumb questions and think &amp;ldquo;stupid thoughts&amp;rdquo; end up understanding things much more deeply over time. Conversely, when I look at people who have a very deep understanding of topics, many of them frequently ask naive sounding questions and continue to apply one of the techniques that got them a deep understanding in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/interviews/detail92.html&#34;&gt;Scents and Sensibility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps our sense of this, the sense of belonging to a world held together by networks of ephemeral confidences (such as philosophies and stock markets) rather than permanent certainties, predisposes us to embrace the pleasures of our most primitive and unlangued sense. Being mystified doesn&amp;rsquo;t frighten us as much as it used to. And the point for me is not to expect perfumery to take its place in some nice, reliable, rational world order, but to expect everything else to become like perfume.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Q and A</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently met with one of the researchers in my lab to discuss a project I got involved with two years ago. There were some issues with the analyses I ran, but no one had brought them to my attention until now. Why had it taken so long, I wondered, to point these errors out? And why didn’t I receive more mentorship and feedback when the analyses were being conducted, especially considering that I was (and still am) a research rookie? Back then I didn’t know what I didn’t know, but everyone else around me did, presumably. Why didn’t they train and guide me if the project was at all important? They were the veterans, yet I was given full responsibility over the bulk of the statistical and technical work required for scientific publication. I wasn’t clueless and consented to helping with the project, but not to this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was annoyed at my naivety, but also the lack of communication all throughout. Maybe this why many graduate students feel &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/the-emotional-toll-of-graduate-school/&#34;&gt;exploited&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://ga.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wellbeingreport_2014.pdf&#34;&gt;overworked&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe this is why the researcher I met with mentioned that I deserved more credit and higher authorship on the paper. He’s more familiar with the lay of the land and suggested that I step away from the project after fixing the few errors so that the others could do their share. I knew the people I worked with didn’t mean to put me in this position and to leave me hanging when I asked for help and clarity. But it happens more frequently than one may expect, in a nearly invisible, subconscious way. You have to advocate for yourself in academia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All things considered, my sense of confidence and competence has grown. It’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-940DEED8113AF932A35754C0A9649D8B63.html&#34;&gt;busy&lt;/a&gt; (ew), but I’m enjoying the intellectual challenges of my graduate courses and the energy of the people they attract. Math equations and statistical concepts are easier to grasp, and I’m starting to help others do the same. I don’t know if I’ve developed a better frame of mind or set of routines to manage myself, but I feel better than I did last year when I was a fresh graduate student. There’s a steadiness and reassuring consistency to the madness now. I still feel inadequate at times, but not entirely out of my depth. I think I’m right where I need to be, scrounging for knowledge and understanding – and a thesis project to work on – but not meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Loss, Tragedy, and Retaining our Humanity</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/loss-tragedy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A close friend of mine, S, was in a severe car accident recently. She was with her housemate, E, who was driving in a hurry to meet someone. On the way there they struck three other cars that were stopped at a red light. The four people in the vehicle they directly crashed into died, and a few others were injured. A blood test later found that he was under the influence of alcohol and other illicit substances.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was relieved to hear that she was safe and alive, but also angry and sad and in search of someone to blame. She knew this would be the case and patiently held the weight of my grievances. When I finished she calmly stated that she understood my frustration, then reminded me that there are many sides to a story. E was an outstanding person she said, a wild beast contained in a small body, a free spirit who burned like a flame fueled by inexhaustible embers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He played music for her when she wanted to dance by herself in the kitchen. He cooked for her and spiced up her cooking when she wasn’t looking. He mourned with her when her dear grandmother passed away. He led nature exploration and conversation projects, spearheaded caving, canyoning, and climbing schools, and conducted environmental research. He savored every moment and made her a better person. The woman he loved, Rosalie, came to the house after hearing about the accident and cried herself to sleep in his empty bed. “E, je suis avec toi,” the note she left him read.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;S mentioned these things not to rectify E or to justify his actions, but to emphasize the fact that even the best of us make poor decisions, that this could have been any one of us behind the wheel. She felt the deep pain of the people implicated in this tragedy, and also the shame and guilt that E would have to live with for the rest of his life. “Every gift has its shadow” she often said to me. The flame that fueled E was also the light that blindsided him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult for me to hold these seeming contradictions in mind: that a man who killed four others and could have killed my close friend is still good and worthy of forgiveness. S knows it’s possible though. She and many others have been the recipient of his care and goodness, and there are numerous stories of parents who, in time, forgive the murderer of their children. In time they find meaning, not as a way to turn from the truth, but as a salve that allows them to live with the messiness of their new reality. There will of course be those who cannot forgive him, who will demonize him, who will see only one side of the story. I understand and don’t blame them, as I’m sure E would too. It is likely that he will spend years in jail with the burden and meaning of his continued existence, while the friends and family members of those he killed must learn how to live on. Accountability, due process, rage, and grief are appropriate and necessary, but we mustn’t lose sight of our humanity and love in the process. Already so much has been lost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Turning 28</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the age of 28 my father was raising two kids, the writer Maria Popova was composing her “Figuring”, and the student Oliver Sacks had yet to revolutionize medicine and hundreds of thousands of lives. For many others past and present it’s an age never reached, a milestone perched in the imagination but the distance left untraversed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our earlier, more predictable years – school, rules, and authority figures trying to ruin our fun – provide only a small fraction of what the future will be like. Given this, it’s hard to imagine that there’s anything worth looking forward to when you yourself become “one of them”, the grown-ups. But the past ten years have taught me there is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can travel alone. You can learn how to rollerblade, slackline, and play the guitar in the midst of a pandemic. You can explore and question consciousness and its contents, sometimes with the help of a capped friend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can make friends online and go ice skating in Boston. You can watch sunsets on the rooftop of mountains bathing in alpenglow over blueberry pie. You can fall in and out of love – with music, with books, with ideas, with strangers – over and over again, at all scales of experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can quit. You can grow. You can die and be born again in the minds of others. You can start a venture, fail, and still succeed because you tried it and you gave it your all the way you once gave everything your all as a child with no eye toward consequence and opinion. It didn’t matter as long as you were doing it all out of joy and love.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At times I still feel like the 16 year old striving to become a competitive League of Legends player, the lost boy of 24 searching for himself on a trek across Spain, the shy kid of 21 tasting freedom for the first time on a meditation cushion. These younger versions of me are deeply engraved like faded tattoos, and my body is fully covered. Yet skin is dynamic and being is a process, not a final rest stop we arrive at once a certain age is reached. There is always room for more, even in the simplest of lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have some sense of direction now. I’m loved, in love, and have always been loved. I’m smart enough to stay dumb and dumb enough to keep chasing out of curiosity, love, and beauty. I’m committed to things bigger than myself, and my life feels simultaneously whole and full of potential.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s scary sometimes, this constant change. It involves openness, letting go, and letting in, always acts of vulnerability. But worse to me is the still image of stagnation, the unformed person who believes his life had peaked in college, the couples who lose their individuality and have nothing left to learn from and give to each other, a society with divides that nail you to the cross of their narrow narrative while they themselves are divided. Worse to me are lives without life, eyes that don’t see, bodies unembodied, hearts that don’t feel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have two kinds of birthdays: the one when we’re born, and the one when we’re born again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>On Writing</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/on-writing/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/on-writing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Years ago, when I finished my walk across the Camino de Santiago, I returned to California to stay with my parents while figuring out what my next steps would be. The irony was that I had gone on the journey to do exactly this, to find direction. But all I came back with were clouded thoughts and vague impressions of what I cared about. My worldview had shifted, but in ways I didn’t quite yet understand. I felt like a fish who had just discovered he was swimming in something called water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I walked around aimlessly every day on the long stretches of empty sidewalks, as if I were on the Camino, retracing footsteps and memories, longing to be seen. No one around me understood, and the few books I managed to read offered only abstractions. There was one person who could have helped, but we had parted ways in Belgium. I knew what she would say though if she saw me in this liminal state: that I had to give the gift of being seen to myself, the way I had given it to her.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This meant that I had to write about it. The extent of my writing was limited to online chat rooms and video games, but it seemed like the only way to make sense of the experience. I finished an incomplete version of the story in two months, but the point wasn’t to capture the totality of my walk and then be done with it. It was to engage in the act of writing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the attempt to put words and structure to feeling and thought, we claim full ownership over the narratives that we live by. As a result the meaning of our experiences changes, as does the experience itself. Writing about the Camino helped me process what I was feeling, but it also made me see and relive it in a different way. The most important bits went down on paper and became a part of me, which shaped how I remembered and wrote the rest of the story. In this cycle of extraction and refinement, we are created.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The practice has stuck with me since. Even when I think I have nothing to write about, I try to write something. In the process I’m often surprised and find that I did have more to say than previously thought. Feeling and thinking are clarified through writing. It’s sharper and more patient than conversation where words are thrown around like weightless rocks. In text they stick and leave us more vulnerable than when we started, the gift of which is to be truly seen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I write for many reasons –  to grow; to become a better person; to make the familiar and obvious strange and novel; to push others to reconsider their beliefs; to engage in meaningful conversation – but what really drives me is much simpler: I write because to do otherwise is unthinkable. Because I have something to say. Because it takes me beyond myself and into something sacred, something that requires devotion, focus, and attention. But that’s love baby. We are born and made in love.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/snail.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in the basement of the hospital facilitating an MRI scan with a teen. He&amp;rsquo;s 15 and a little nervous – by his account he hasn&amp;rsquo;t ever completed an entire scan with us. But he hopes this will be the first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just a few weeks ago he had another first. I wondered: how did he get his hands on it? Was he alone or in company? How did it make him feel?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His parents know and disapprove, but understand. They see themselves in his laugh, in his mistakes, in his eyes. The same eyes that once wanted nothing more than their love and attention. The same eyes that cried the entire car ride on the first day of kindergarten. The same eyes that so easily turn and shy away from them now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There they will look at his worst and his best. There they will look when he is lying. There they will look for the one that was once theirs, is theirs, and has yet to be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everything changes – it&amp;rsquo;s life&amp;rsquo;s only guarantee. Everything except his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Grad School Diaries: One Year Down</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/one-year/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m done with my first year of graduate school. The sun&amp;rsquo;s out. I&amp;rsquo;m alive. Yay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last semester was a long one. Some days I was motivated to work on my assigned projects; other days I wanted to drop them, drop out, and do something completely different. Mostly I felt like a directionless ship in the ocean without any stars or a compass to guide me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet, somehow, here I am, newly arrived, on the coastline of some familiar land. Another ending, another beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, what have I learned so far?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;on-perserverance&#34;&gt;On Perserverance&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Graduate school is a lot like learning how to slackline. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult at first as you build your muscles and learn how to keep your balance. You will fall, a lot, and everyone else will seem like they&amp;rsquo;re masters of academic gymnastics. But if you keep at it, you will get better. At utilizing your strengths. At asking for help. At knowing when to push and when to rest. At learning. At being kind to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It truly is a game of perseverance. It only ends when you put away the slackline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;on-doing-and-thinking&#34;&gt;On Doing and Thinking&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I worked on a research project with one of my classmates, Julia, exploring what we called ‘Character Space’ using online survey data. The survey consisted of 200+ personality ratings for each of 800 fictional characters from shows like &lt;em&gt;Avatar: the Last Airbender&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;LOST&lt;/em&gt;. Rather than describe each character in terms of all the traits, we wondered if instead they could be described in terms of some combination of them. For example, if Aang from &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; took a test like the Myer-Briggs (a psychologically invalid and meaningless test btw), what would his four letters be?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We used Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to explore this question. Neither of us knew anything about the method, but it was relatively easy to implement using the programming language Python. We got immediate results, but it wasn’t clear what the dimensions meant. That became the bulk of our project – retracing our steps and digging through the linear algebra so that we could describe the character space. Only then were we able to make reasonable (if you squint your eyes enough) conclusions, and explain the limitations of our approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was necessary for us to use these tools without having full knowledge of how they worked; it&amp;rsquo;s too easy to fall into academic analysis paralysis, to spend too much time in the weeds of the mechanics, to never produce anything. But it certainly would have helped if either of us had the prior knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Much of research, and life, is like this: No matter how prepared you are, you are constantly working with the unknown. This isn’t to say that preparation and understanding aren’t necessary, just that they aren’t sufficient on their own. One has to teeter between thinking and doing, perhaps with a slight bent toward the latter. The goal is always to produce knowledge, to live life, not to sit around and think about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;on-projects-and-priorities&#34;&gt;On Projects and Priorities&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I took more of a supportive role this semester in the two research projects I worked on. This made me feel somewhat guilty because I believed I was supposed to be the person spearheading ideas and paving the direction of each project. What helped was realizing that research is a collaborative effort, and that I actually enjoyed serving as a second hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine in a neuroimaging graduate program had posted on Instagram asking if anyone could help her with some technical issues related to her final project. I offered a hand, and we were able to quickly resolve the issue that had stumped her the entire day. She thanked me for the help, and also for running the summer programming workshop I had organized a few years ago when she was still a research assistant in my lab. I had forgotten about that and how fun it was to teach and help others be successful. Perhaps there&amp;rsquo;s a direction here. I want to continue working on interesting, meaningful problems, without necessarily being the lead researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;on-asking-the-right-questions&#34;&gt;On Asking the Right Questions&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s really hard to ask the right questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes they&amp;rsquo;re productive and lead to generative insights. Often times they lead us down rabbit holes that only reveal to us our capacity for blind tenacity, a trait that is commonly exploited in academia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a big part of science: Refining the questions we ask, exploring them, and helping others ask better ones with what we find. Maybe there are no right questions, simply better ones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;on-faith-the-future&#34;&gt;On Faith the Future&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All scientists are secretly operating on faith, perhaps without explicitly acknowledging it. We have at best tentative answers, which are outnumbered by the questions yet explored.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I still have no clue what I&amp;rsquo;m doing. I feel an urge to sharpen my math and statistics, to read some research papers, to dive into bookmarked lectures. Yet how much of this is due to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.briantimar.com/notes/mimetic/mimetic/&#34;&gt;mimetic trap&lt;/a&gt;? To the demands and pressure of the academic world?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe, right now, it&amp;rsquo;s better to do nothing. To let my mind wander and be fertile again. To figure things out as I go. To have some faith in myself. For now, I have a stack of neglected books dying to be read, a guitar that needs playing, a girlfriend to love, and words to write.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>On Uncertainty, Bayes&#39; Theorem, and Love</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/bayes-uncertainty-love/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The math was manageable if I squinted my eyes hard enough, but the big picture had yet to coalesce. I was out of chia pudding, and the last of my coffee was gone. I was stumped.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then the unexpected happened.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was at a coffee shop working on everything &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; my obligated research projects, like good graduate students do. My latest distraction was neuroscientist Karl Friston&amp;rsquo;s Free Energy Principle. It&amp;rsquo;s a bold attempt at a unified theory of the brain involving lots of heady math like information theory, dynamical systems, computational neuroscience, and others. At its heart though is Bayesian statistics, a school of statistical thought that had recently captured my attention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She was sitting two seats to my right reading a red paperback. Stray threads of black fell across her dark eyes, and a slim mask covered her face. Feathered earrings were hiding behind her long black hair. Her blue summer dress was dotted with pink flamingos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She asked if it was fine to sit nearby, and I said yes. I threw myself back into my textbook shortly after, but couldn’t help and be reminded of my hopelessly romantic fantasy of dating someone I had met in a bookstore or coffee shop. It was a silly thought, and I retreated to the certainty of my Bayesian equations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But what if?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bayesian statistics is built atop of Bayes’ Theorem, a simple mathematical framework for quantifying how one should update their beliefs in light of new data or information. It’s a powerful tool in the research setting, but some people also use it as a heuristic for thinking and decision making in their personal life. This seems like a stretch to me, but uncertainty makes us do crazy things. Like statistics. Or falling in love.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She asked for a pen to borrow, and I lent her my spare. I continued to work for the next hour or so, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t long before I felt completely out of brain juice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m prepared to leave when she asks me about what I was working on. I mentioned something about math, statistics, uncertainty, and the brain, and she shared her thoughts on the red paperback in her hands. Time stuttered in its steps as stories were exchanged. By the end she was in possession of mine, and I a phone number.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s usually intractable to compute the posterior distribution – the Bayesian object that quantifies the uncertainty surrounding our updated beliefs – because most of the problems we care about are complex and involve too many variables to account for. What’s often done instead is that the posterior is approximated. We construct an estimated picture using samples drawn by a computer. With more guesses and draws, the picture gets better and better until it’s close to the solution we’re looking for. But it’s no guarantee that the solution is right.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class = &#34;poem&#34;&gt;&#xA;* *Walking Home*&#xA;* &#xA;* *What if the sun wanted to sleep in?*&#xA;* *What if the seat next to me was taken?*&#xA;* *What if I understood myself and Bayesian statistics?*&#xA;* *What if her friends had stuck with their plans?*&#xA;* *What if she didn&#39;t like coffee?*&#xA;* *What if everything that made sense didn&#39;t make sense?*&#xA;* *What if magic was in the eyes of the beholder?*&#xA;* &amp;nbsp;&#xA;* *Would the world still be as beautiful?*&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Friston thinks the brain works like this. He claims it’s akin to a Bayesian inference machine, something that is constantly processing information from our senses and internal states in order to create accurate mental models of the world so that we can operate in it with some degree of certainty. The world is uncertain, and it’s the brain’s job to reduce it to something more manageable. But what do we lose in the process?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I liked her. I liked her a lot. She was smart, funny, and a good conversationalist. I felt comfortable and wholly myself in her presence. But I was still holding onto someone from the past.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It had been awhile since I last saw her. We were good to and with each other, but she was dealing with her own struggles. A new adventure in Washington DC was also on the horizon. I wanted her to grow and be happy, but a part of me was still hanging onto the hope that things would somehow work out. I knew they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t cut my heartstrings yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was only after I met the girl in the coffee shop that I realized I was ready to let go of hope and embrace the uncertainty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;All models are wrong, but some are useful&amp;rdquo; – it’s a phrase that&amp;rsquo;s preached to all up-and-coming researchers and scientists. The idea is that models are simple caricatures, small worlds used to describe the larger, messy whole of reality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We need them, but they’re silhouettes, shadows, not the real thing. They help us become less wrong, but never truly right. No matter how good our models are, there’s always a degree of uncertainty involved. So what’s left when our models fail?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feathered earrings. A blue summer dress dotted with pink flamingos. Stray threads of black strutting across dark eyes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Possibility exists in the dance between ease and tension, between knowing and uncertainty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re on a walk, the sun is beaming, and I want to pay close attention, note every detail, savor the moment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Grad School Diaries: inward to outward, holding tension</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As spring buds and the end of the pandemic draws closer in (hazy yet optimistic) sight, I find myself savoring the days more often than I do reflecting on them. Questions revolving around life and meaning are more playful and grounded than they are personal and existential. I feel light, happy, and engaged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a funny contrast to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://philintheblank.me/blog/2021/02/grad-school-diaries-dancing-with-doubt/&#34;&gt;panicked state a few weeks ago regarding graduate school&lt;/a&gt;. Quitting had suddenly presented itself as a desirable option, and I considered pursuing the clinical psychologist route again. But something pulled me back. It was a gut feeling full of doubts that said I should stay, though I knew if I stayed that I had to reorient the expectations I had set for myself. I had to play to my strengths and stop comparing myself to my professor and others. I had to care much less about my academic performance and focus instead on learning and having fun in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This, thankfully and surprisingly, was a saving grace that came easily. I’m learning much more now and have rediscovered the joy of following your curiosity for its own sake. Social issues, scientific problems, and even personal questions have coalesced into a more interconnected, complicated whole worth most if not all of my attention. I want to better understand these things not just because they’re interesting intellectual exercises (they are), but also because I think they’re important.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the context of social issues, this means adopting the uncomfortable stance of devil’s advocate. Naturally I tend to do this in conversations I have with my friends, but there’s always some hesitation in playing the role, even if I feel comfortable with the other person. No one likes to be wrong, especially in regard to things like race, sex, religion, and so on. But that shouldn’t hold us back from these touchy conversations. If there’s no willingness to be wrong, how can be ever inch closer to resolving these issues? It’s certainly harder to allow yourself to be wrong these days, for a multitude of reasons, but it doesn’t have to be like this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To give a more concrete example: race is on everyone’s mind as of late. What I wonder though is why the current conversation surrounding it sounds so divisive. What happened to the more unifying, spiritual, self-transcendent vision of MLK? Of James Baldwin? These are two (of many) activists who are venerated, but largely ignored in the modern conversation. Why?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is it because King is loftier in his views, and thus they are harder to adopt and implement? Is it because King sought to transcend our basic tribalistic human tendencies with ideals and principles that are impossible to achieve? Yet what makes us capital H human but our ability to make possible what was once thought to be the opposite? Ideals and principles aren’t useful insofar as they’re meant to be achieved; their utility and power lies within their aspirational quality. They lead us to be better than we are.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, how did King’s ideas stick and incite the Civil Rights Movement, despite our deeply rooted in-group/out-group tendencies? There are major red flags with many of the propositions and conclusions of the currently popular activists like Ibram Kendi (he doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be willing to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMAYJUMpStY&amp;amp;feature=emb_title&#34;&gt;debate his ideas&lt;/a&gt; either, another red flag), yet these are the views being widely preached and adopted by people in my circle. Again, I’m just pointing and asking: Why?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bernie Sanders, when announcing his 2019 bid for presidency, mentioned on air that voters should choose candidates “not by the color of their skin but by their abilities and what they stand for”, in response to the widespread criticism that he was just another white guy. Bernie is literally citing almost word for word MLK, yet he was flamed by popular media and the masses not on the merit of what he said, but because, well, because he was just another white guy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wait what? Isn’t that super backwards? Isn’t the place we want to be at one in which race isn’t even relevant in what I think of you as a person? It’s impossible to ignore race, e.g. that I am Asian or look Asian or whatever. But that shouldn’t even be considered in the calculus of how you treat me or what you think of me or how capable I am of doing a particular job. Call me an idiot because I have no clue what I’m talking about. Tell me I’m crazy because I’ve done and said many stupid things – I have. Doubt my abilities. But do it because Phil is Phil, not because he happens to be Asian.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the topic of being Asian, why is no one pointing to the clear racism of college admissions against Asians? Why do they have to work twice as hard to gain the same seat as their non-Asian peers? And what about the Asian kids who are less fortunate who then have to work even harder? There&amp;rsquo;s probably some deep history here that I&amp;rsquo;m unaware of, but I remember my Mom talking to me about this when I was much younger. I had no clue why what she was talking about was important, but thinking back to it now, she was onto something. She never went to college, yet she was smart and insightful enough to know that this was blatant discrimination when it came time to consider the education of her children. She knew that if colleges were solely meritocratic, then we&amp;rsquo;d have a bunch of Asians running around on all campuses across America. But that&amp;rsquo;s not the case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Should colleges be pure meritocracies? No. There has to be some degree of acknowledgment of the unquantifiable variability that defines much of our lives, for better and for worse. Test scores and writing ability shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be everything. But what else should count then? Because there are only a limited number of seats, not just in college, but beyond in life too. And some set of criterion is going to be used to determine what job, resources, positions, or roles we are able to take. Should race matter in these decisions? Knowing that you were chosen for a job because of your race feels as icky as being not chosen because of your race. Knowing that I gained admittance to a college on the basis of my skin color, gender, or some other trait outside my control as opposed to the quality of my character and the expression of my personhood is a deep insult. It&amp;rsquo;s not what MLK would have wanted, nor does it make any long-term sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Around two years ago, I was being dropped off at my parent’s house after having a small reunion with some of my childhood friends. The guy who was dropping me off was someone I had known since elementary school, but I hadn’t seen him since I transferred high schools at the end of Sophomore year – it had been over 5 years since we last spoke. I asked if he had any girls in his life at the moment (he’s a handsome fella), and he casually said “Oh, don’t you know? I’m gay.” I said “Oh sorry, I had no idea,” to which he replied, “Yup, I like big dicks in my butt.” That threw us into a hysterical laughing fit. And then we went on to talk about random shit, like good friends do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mention this story because you can swap the word “gay” out for any other inherent trait and get the same portrait of how we should interact with one another. Beyond that, in regards to the policy level, I’m no expert, but it seems like we would make the most progress on the issue of racism by addressing the core issues plaguing America in general: poverty, poor &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/webdevmason/status/1123073381673267200&#34;&gt;education&lt;/a&gt;, access to equal opportunities, mental health, the prison system, and so on. These things aren’t being talked about nearly enough, and yet they are probably the most promising concrete issues with regard to their influence on race and life outcomes. These are the issues that &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; affect people&amp;rsquo;s day to day lives. They’re not sexy and headline worthy, they don’t directly cater to one race or group or agenda, yet their resolution would help everyone, especially those in need, which of course are many people of color, but also those generally less fortunate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, all I&amp;rsquo;m doing is pointing and asking why? How did we get to this point? I have no clue, only guesses. It’s complicated, and I’m too dumb to know the answer. But then why does everyone else seem to have answers if the issues are so entangled?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So yeah… these are the things I’m thinking about lately. Clearly these are mostly observations without any direct link to many sources, so I’m always open to chatting and learning. Other (more interesting) things on my mind: Friston’s Free Energy Principle and its connection to Bayesian inference; Psychedelics and their therapeutic benefits (go Oregon!); trauma and resilience; music and playing guitar; my parents and getting older; girls and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back to the start. It feels like there&amp;rsquo;s not as big of a Me at the center of my life anymore. I’ve moved on from the soul-searching to soul-building phase (both are entwined ofc), one that involves stepping beyond myself and being wrong about many things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Grad School Diaries: Dancing with Doubt</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/dancing-with-doubt/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/dancing-with-doubt/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A self-therapy session&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was a rough week for me. I spent over 25 hours on a single assignment for one of my classes, Data Science II. Most of the problems involved deriving probability distributions and some of their properties, and I struggled due to my lack of solid grounding in calculus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t sure how to gauge whether my struggles simply indicated a lack of mathematical fluency, which is something that could be remedied through practice and a firmer grasp of the fundamentals, or if I just wasn’t “getting” it at some deeper intuitive level. This led me to wonder if I would ever get it, if not to the degree that my professor does, then at least to the degree of any other data scientist in the field. When some of them talk about and do math, it looks like a magical sleight of hand, despite knowing how much work they&amp;rsquo;ve probably put into their studies. Still, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but feel that there is more to it than that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I talked with my classmate Julia about this. Neither of us have academic backgrounds in math (she studied linguistics, I psychology), so we feel somewhat out of our element when it comes to some of the finer technical details. We lean heavily on analogies and intuition more than anything, but sometimes it doesn’t feel like it’s enough. Sometimes the intuition only makes sense after one has worked for that understanding. But how hard should one try to reach that intuitive level? And what should one do if that point is never reached? Should we accept that we will never be as good as some of these other folks, that it won&amp;rsquo;t ever feel as easy as walking? Or will stubbornness and persistence be our savior? Is it good enough to be good enough? I think the answer to that has to be yes, for sanity&amp;rsquo;s sake. And I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are many organizations or groups of people in the world who would be happy to receive help from any average data scientist – not everyone needs a theory-stoned academic to solve their problems. They just want their problems solved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So maybe what matters then is being useful. Wherever we fall on the grand distribution of things, we can always be useful to someone. That’s reassuring. But then there are an infinite number of ways to be useful! And some of those ways are better suited for us than others, depending on things like personality, interests, and values. These are not minor considerations to ignore when reflecting on what is worth doing with your time, because that&amp;rsquo;s what it boils down to. Anything worth doing in the long run involves expected challenges of course. But when they deprecate to a form of chronic struggle, when they make you feel as if you were sleepwalking through life, you have to ask yourself about why you’re pursuing that thing in the first place, and if you truly enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/doubt1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This begs the question: is enjoyment really that important in a career? Well, if The Why is the mission, then enjoyment is what defines our experience of it. It’s usually implied that we do enjoy what we work on, given that most of us do get a choice. But what we think we enjoy and even what we do enjoy can get distorted by things like money and prestige. Paired the two with ambition and you have yourself a deadly lifetime cocktail. It matters to see through this illusion, not just because to do something well you have to enjoy it, but also because your work defines so much of your life. This doesn’t mean that you’re supposed to be head-over-heels every waking hour when working, because there are some things you just have to persist through. But would you be doing what you&amp;rsquo;re doing if you were given the freedom and security to do whatever you wanted to do? And if you could get at The Why in a more enjoyable way that caters to you as a person, why aren’t you doing that instead?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other day I watched a video titled “Why I’m Not a Scientist” by Youtuber Derek of Veritasium. In it he shares his story about why he pursued something more artistic rather than academic. As a youth, in addition to biology, chemistry, and physics, he was interested in many other things like music, acting, and making silly videos with his friends. It turned out that the latter suited his personality more, and he also realized that he liked the idea of being a successful scientist more than the actual process of doing science. That realization was what led him to pursue a Ph.D. in Physics Education Research rather than one in Physics. Now he’s a Youtuber.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mention this not because I want to dissuade anyone or myself from science, but because I think it underscores the importance of knowing who you are and what your limits might be, and not to run from that. I look over at my bookshelf and see that it’s full of poetry and short story collections, novels, and psychology books: The Body Keeps the Score. The Art of Seeing Things. How to Change Your Mind. Transcend. The Fear of Doing Nothing. The Denial of Death. Already Free. These books feel self-defining and magnifying, like old friends who know you better than you know yourself. I love hanging out with them, while others would love hanging out with the technical books sitting on my bottom shelf.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m pretty certain that I like knowing about the world more than being the guy who generates its knowledge, scientifically speaking. Thinking about the sorts of conversations I have with my closest friends, words like healer, writer, artist, psychologist are thrown at me in both nonchalant and serious tones. Even my Dad has joined that parade a few times. I’ve helped many of them with personal issues and naturally gravitate towards these sorts of conversations. Others find it exhausting to listen to people&amp;rsquo;s problems like this, but for me it feels invigorating. Rather than study stories, which is what I’ve begun to do as part of my graduate program, this other potential version of me is writing them and helping others write and rewrite theirs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have my moments when I lose myself in research projects and spontaneous readings of academic papers. But as to whether or not I’ll continue doing research afterwards, I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure yet. Not for lack of trying, because some people like the PI of my study and others think I can genuinely do it - and I am doing it! - but because I feel a fundamental disconnect between how I&amp;rsquo;m spending my time and what I feel my strengths are. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I think I&amp;rsquo;m wasting my time - I just don&amp;rsquo;t see myself doing research day in and day out. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t make my heart sing the way it does for some of my amazing peers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Am I just being lazy? Am I limiting my own potential with this kind of thinking? To some, maybe. But I really don’t think so. Life takes shape when we constrain ourselves, and the best constraint is knowing who you really are and what you enjoy most. Accepting this, perhaps paradoxically, unlocks so much more. You start make things work for you rather than against you, wherever you go. You stop conforming to fit into boxes not meant for you anyways, while creating more space for others to do the same. In the process you&amp;rsquo;re seen as a fearless trailblazer, an innovator, a creative independent, a leader, when all you&amp;rsquo;re really doing is being yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/doubt2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some instructions for when things get hard: Confront your limits with grace. Try your best in what you do, but don’t beat yourself up for not being as good as others – there will always be someone better than you. Enjoy the opportunity to learn instead. Be you. Make it work for you. And don’t define yourself solely by your work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“…The Jews also talk about how God judges you for your gifts. Rabbi Zusya once said that when he died, he wasn’t worried that God would ask him “Why weren’t you Moses?” or “Why weren’t you Solomon?” But he did worry that God might ask ‘Why weren’t you Rabbi Zusya?’&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And this is part of why it’s important for me to believe in innate ability, and especially differences in innate ability. If everything comes down to hard work and a positive attitude, then God has every right to ask me ‘Why weren’t you Srinivasa Ramanujan?’ or ‘Why weren’t you Elon Musk?’&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If everyone is legitimately a different person with a different brain and different talents and abilities, then all God gets to ask me is whether or not I was Scott Alexander.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This seems like a gratifyingly low bar.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>A Data Scientist Walks into a Bar</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/data-scientist/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 20 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A dispirited data scientist walks into a moderately populated bar, makes his way to the counter, and plops himself onto a vacant seat. It&amp;rsquo;s Wednesday afternoon. The bartender knows what’s coming and has already prepared a double shot of vodka for her new weekly patron.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Another tough day in the tower huh&amp;rdquo;, the bartender says. &amp;ldquo;Is this gonna be a recurring pattern? I mean, not just you and the double shots.&amp;rdquo; She slides the drink across to him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;See, here&amp;rsquo;s the thing,” Henri begins. ”Instead of solving proofs and developing their theorems, those damn mathematicians are on my ass again with that same stupid question! They keep asking me in their pretentious tone &amp;lsquo;so Hen, what do you do really do as a data scientist&amp;rsquo;, as if I were a waste of taxpayer dollars. It is exponentially aggravating.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bartender smirks. &amp;ldquo;Exponentially huh? That’s a new one.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes! That&amp;rsquo;s precisely it feels.&amp;rdquo; Henri slams the double shot back. &amp;ldquo;Another one please. And don&amp;rsquo;t even get me started about the computer scientists and statisticians this week.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Kid, you really gotta watch yourself with the double shots. Your remaining brain cells will thank you later. Besides, what&amp;rsquo;s the big deal? Aren’t they all just arbitrary titles?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Not in my world.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bartender rolls her eyes. “You’ll have to elaborate then. If my philosophy degree has taught me anything, it’s that none of this matters.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Oh quit being so cynical Mal.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Well we wouldn’t be having this discussion if you didn’t at least partly believe me. It’s all just smoke and mirrors, means of further division veiled behind the oh-so-noble guise of academic progress, when in reality things are more connected than the specs would like us to believe. Hell, doesn’t it all just boil down to math? Science I mean: generating supposedly novel hypotheses, testing said hypotheses, and publishing results in ivory-encased journals – if you’re lucky – all of which must be reduced to fancy models and statistics in order to garner any form of western validity, aka mathematics.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Oh come on, you sound just like them now.” Henri begins to trace the rim of his empty drinking glass, then looks up. “Okay think about neuroscience. You’ve got computational neuroscience, developmental neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience, and now the up-and-coming hotshots of network neuroscience. Sure, there’s some overlap, and sure they all involve mathematics, statistics, and computer science. But the focus of each is on different problems, different open questions within the umbrella of neuroscience. The discipline guides the questions.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mal meets Henri’s pensive gaze. “Tell me then: what’s the focus of data science? Which reminds me, I read an article in the Harvard Business Review the other day that said being a data scientist is the sexiest job of the 21st century. You should do a study on that! ‘Cultural perception of scientists in the 21st century’. I bet that’ll get published.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, Obama had a chief data scientist during his presidency too. But that’s beside the point. The emergence of data science is partly a response to the deluge of data we’re now faced with thanks to the advent of personal computers and the internet. God, I used to be worried about running out of storage on my 5 gigabyte iPod – which was so much memory not too long ago! – and now we’re drowning in yotta- and zettabytes.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Imagine that. We’re gonna need more letters in the alphabet.” Mal grins. ”Now that’d be an innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Precisely. And I don’t think it’s slowing down anytime soon. The data comes in so many forms, from tweets and cute cat pictures to puppy emojis and YouTube Videos. It wasn’t feasible to analyze any of this prior to our current computing capabilities. The scale is jarring frankly, and it additionally requires one to think about the cleaning, management, and storage of all this data. This specific combination of problems isn’t focused on by the mathematics, statistics, and computer science holy trifecta.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“So let me get this straight. Data science is about leveraging modern computers to manage, process, and analyze this growing tsunami of data, all of which comes in forms not previously considered prior to the genesis of the information society?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, I’d say that’s a good summary.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mal laughs. “Sounds like applied statistics and computer science, and math.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Okay okay, but that’s a bit decontextualized. You have to frame science in terms of the problems the field is concerned with. And data science is specific to, well, data, virtually always of the digital kind. There’s data visualization too, which has always been important in communicating science, but has taken more of a center-stage position alongside all the other aspects of data science thanks to the increasing number of tools available and more computational power.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“What about the ethics of all this?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“That’s another important dimension of data science, although I can’t say we’ve been terribly good at putting it to practice. Just isn’t in the job description or the culture.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Great, just what humanity ordered.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Hey that’s where your philosophy background would come in handy.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Well, when institutions and companies stop suggesting and start backing their words with jobs and paychecks I’ll consider it. Until then I’m left to commiserate with data scientists and their identity crises in the bright limelight of Shakeys.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Henri perks up. “There are others?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Yep.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not alone!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mal pours Henri another drink. “Computational statistician.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“What?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“You’re a computational statistician, full stop.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Henri considers it. “Data scientist sounds better.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>The Vietnamese Refugee Experience: Interviewing my parents</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally made the time to interview my parents about growing up in Vietnam, escaping the aftermath of the war, becoming a refugee, and starting a new life in America.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Their stories are ones of finding meaning in loss, reconfigurations of identity, and leaps of faith. They are stories of the human spirit at work, and of gracious serendipity. Their stories keep my own in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;moms-interview-listen-on-youtube-directly-for-timestamps&#34;&gt;Mom&amp;rsquo;s interview (listen on YouTube directly for timestamps):&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MjBW7R8Vl78&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;dads-interview-part-1-listen-on-youtube-directly-for-timestamps&#34;&gt;Dad&amp;rsquo;s interview (part 1: listen on YouTube directly for timestamps):&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WLhvK9vH6xs&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;dads-interview-part-2-listen-on-youtube-directly-for-timestamps&#34;&gt;Dad&amp;rsquo;s interview (part 2: listen on YouTube directly for timestamps):&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vl8Q89YDTJs&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/seeds4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I think about the past year, I see a child clad in the slowness of seasons, walking the same path by the same lake in the same woods over and over again, searching for something solid to hang onto, comfort in the familiarity of dirt roads, dressed trees, and footsteps perhaps, certainly meaning, in the face of a reality that has just turned dream-like. Sometimes he stops to skip rocks across the water, hoping they will carry his worries with them. He doesn’t know where he’s going, only that he must keep going.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This year has been one of the most challenging to date, for obvious reasons. What wasn’t obvious was the shape that my struggles would take and the arcs created and traversed in attempting to resolve them. Given my optimistic nature and proclivity for solitary endeavors, I initially treated news of the pandemic as an opportunity of sorts on the personal front; the impending solitude would serve as the bedrock of my creative muse, the social restrictions a chance to explore and deepen the relationship I had with myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This buoyed optimism lasted for a month, tops. What I didn’t anticipate was the necessary reconfiguration of what would give me meaning in the longer days to come when the world finally shut itself down. Plans to visit family for the holidays, hiking the Tour du Mont Blanc prior to starting graduate school, seeing and sending my penpal Alyona off before she returned to Russia; everything had to be cancelled. The degradation of meaning became most visceral in the weeks my lab began transitioning to remote work after our research was put on pause. The emptied office rooms, the reassuring goodbyes shrouding the uncertainty of future reunion, computer screens left vacant in the dark. The architecture that once held up my life was collapsing, and nothing threatens our existence more than the loss of meaning and the emptiness of boredom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With a lack of replacements for my usual affairs and the things I looked forward to, I resorted to pastime comforts: video games – League of Legends in particular. But it wasn’t as fun as it used to be. It certainly didn’t provide the same meaning that it once did when I was a decent player trying to make it big in the then emerging e-sports scene. I then started slacklining, practiced guitar more seriously, wrote many poems, and began rollerblading again (after 16-17 years?). Put another way, I was trying to do something productive, but it felt contrived at times, like I was distracting myself from the truth that I was flailing in deep waters, with the shoreline nowhere near in sight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/seeds5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also didn’t anticipate how lonely some days would be. Part of this was due to the fact that I was becoming a stranger to myself in that I was adopting new habits, hobbies, and ways of thinking about and interacting with the world, which is always, at least initially, a disciplined pursuit rather than a natural process. Though some days were just painfully lonely too, both physically in how far I felt from people, and mentally in the implications of a civilization being forced to confront its own mortality under the knuckle of dumb politics and a ravenous coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many emotional conversations with friends I fell out of touch with after college soon followed. One in particular stirred me to the bone. We were close, but it had been five years since we last spoke. We reminisced about the first time we met in Applied Psychology, about the meditation program we both participated in later that summer, about the friendship we once had. After mentioning that I had a huge crush on her that year, she revealed that there were many things she should have but did not say to me: that she was in a physically abusive relationship, that her relationship with her family was fragmented, that she struggled with drug abuse, that she lived out of her car for a period after graduation, that suicide had nearly taken her life on multiple occasions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/seeds6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We were always able to get deep about life, but never too deep, vulnerable, but never enough to be truly seen. I took her hesitation as a sign that we were to remain platonic friends, but never as a consequence of inner turmoil. Things were better now she said. She’s in a supportive relationship and is pursuing a nursing degree. But she had never told her story to anyone before, not even to her current partner. I was the first to hold it, and this time the tears came.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Catching tears. It certainly gives me meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/seeds7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I’ve learned anything in the midst of this year, it’s that we need each other more than we can ever realize, at all scales. Us students in the complex systems program are trained to quantify, model, and interrogate the implications of this idea – the interconnected nature of things – but you only need to have retained a bit of your child-like imagination to feel the tide of a world stitched together by infinitely many threads.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most jarring cascade following the onset of the pandemic has been that of how we experience time. Our [days, weeks, months] are less eventful in the usual sense, and therefore lack the glue, the stories and moments, that would have otherwise distinguished one [day, week, month] from the next. A consequence of this is that it becomes difficult to remember, well, anything. Memories require context, from which meaning is construed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This collective amnesia was another contributing factor to my growing sense of isolation, leading me to spend more time inhabiting online spaces. They have been a saving grace in many respects, but I can’t help feeling increasingly disembodied the more time I spend on them. Participation in these spaces involves embedding your attention, which is to say your Self (the buddhist in me is speaking), into a timeline that operates on a timescale vastly different from the one we’re capable of processing. Events here occur at a faster rate, often without context (goodbye story, goodbye meaning), and they lack the viscosity of first-hand experience. The result is what feels like lost time, muddled memories, and further fragmentation of the Self.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The realm of the digital isn&amp;rsquo;t going anywhere though, so we will have to find ways to reconcile this personal divide, perhaps by merging into it completely, rebelling against it, or developing new identities that can hold the tension. Who is the person that emerges from these spaces? Surely less of ourselves, but possibly more too. All that we experience shapes us, and we shape all that we experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/seeds8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Music and poetry were essential sources of sustenance, as was the generosity of distant friends and the serendipity of the internet. The website that started my friendship with Alyona, Interpals, also led to meeting Sasha, a stranger who became so much more. We often say that we are cut from the same ethereal thread because we just &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; each other, despite never having met in person. The half-joke between us is that we’re long lost soulmates, but the truth is, that’s the most accurate way to describe what we have between us: we’ve created a home (sometimes called Our Tower) that is freeing and nourishing to inhabit. Ideas, music, poems, vulnerability, and pictures of her cat are the only valid forms of currency in this space governed by play and imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Marieke, my Camino soulmate, liked the idea of life providing us with people who are disguised as angels when we need their grace the most, only leaving once their duty is done. I think what ties Sasha and I together runs along a similar vein. To me it’s the magic referred to by Celine in The Before Trilogy: “I believe if there&amp;rsquo;s any kind of God it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be in any of us, not you or me but just this little space in between. If there&amp;rsquo;s any kind of magic in this world it must be in the attempt of understanding someone sharing something. I know, it&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible to succeed but who cares really? The answer must be in the attempt.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Soulmate. It&amp;rsquo;s a term we usually reserve for romantic partners, but why not be more imaginative and extend its reach to people who are more than that; to people who touch, sustain, and lift our spirits. We need them now more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/seeds10.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something else I didn’t expect this year was how much I would like being a graduate student. I remember telling the PhD-toting Sasha (and my boss, the PI of my study, at one point) early on in the semester that I wanted to quit. But she reminded me that fear often speaks loudest when confronted with difficulty, and nudged me in her quiet way to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s challenging, yes – I wondered daily if I was cut out for all the math and research papers and struggled virtually all the way through the first semester – but that’s the case for most things worth doing; life&amp;rsquo;s challenges are fertile ground for meaning. In the most defining instances you have to parent yourself and become your own hope-generating, meaning-making machine. Not of the rosy, frivolous type, but of the resilient, pragmatic you-can-do-this-and-have-overcome-similar-challenges-so-shut-up-and-stop-doubting-yourself type.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I write to discover meaning,” the poet Louise Glück once noted. “Nothing should be wasted. Something must come of it. And writing is a kind of revenge against circumstance. Bad luck, loss, pain — if you make something out of it, then you’ve no longer been bested by these events.” How we move through – because we can never get over – the heart of uncertainty demands more of us. It demands retreat, rest, and recalibration of the compasses that no longer serve us. It demands us to continue writing, to take revenge against circumstance, to make something out of nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The boy, clad in the slowness of seasons, will continue to walk the same path by the same lake in the same woods over and over again, though the rocks in his fists have transformed into seeds, seeds yearning for soil, seeds beckoning for home, seeds hungry for the forlorn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/hangon.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks&lt;/em&gt;: Shirley, Alyona, Sasha, Eszter, Mom &amp;amp; Dad, Paulina, Mandy, El, Avery, Sam, Olivia, Julia, Cheryl, Alesha, Shana, Corey, Naz, the random people I met while slacklining, and the ABCD crew for the gift of presence and memories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lists for myself, to compensate for the fallibility of memory in 2020&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;timeline-of-notable-things&#34;&gt;Timeline of notable things&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dad gave me his guitar, first pluck of a string: first week of Jan&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Met Alyona in Boston for the first time: &lt;a href=&#34;https://philintheblank.me/blog/2020/01/moments/&#34;&gt;Jan 17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Reconnecting with N: Jan 30&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Acceptance into CSDS graduate prog: Feb 21&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Reconnecting with Corey: ~March&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;NET-COVID Workshop: &lt;a href=&#34;https://philintheblank.me/work/life-after/&#34;&gt;April 16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Started slacklining: Apr 29&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Started talking to Sasha: May 1&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Moved into own apartment: May 22&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First Interintellect salon (topic: Refugees): June 11&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Started hanging with Mandy: Jun 27&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Landing my first full backflip: Jul 21&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hanging out for Joe’s birthday: Jul 26&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lots of hikes with Avery: scattered across the timeline, somewhere here :)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Running into Alesha while slacklining, after 2 years?: Aug 23&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First day of grad school: Aug 31&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sunrise hike with Shana and DK: Sep 25&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First poem published: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.icaf.org/ABCDStudy/&#34;&gt;Oct 16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Interview with VTDigger for holiday season plans: Nov 24&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Thanksgiving Dinner with the neighb, El: Nov 26&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First ever jam session with Eszter and a hang drum: Nov 28&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;First attempt at writing a song on guitar: Dec 7&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;words-of-affirmation&#34;&gt;Words of affirmation&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;your poems are pure magic. they are sewn from the matter that makes me love life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Have you noticed that us put together in a room is pure groundlessness? You and I could talk about the wonders of the universe until we’ve reached complete exhaustion and utter depletion from being so full.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“…what is your superpower? Your whole being is a cure for loneliness…truly. Like how you listen to people, it&amp;rsquo;s medicine for the soul. That deep understanding and great wish to understand the other. That supportive and positive state of mind you are in, the way you&amp;rsquo;re always smiling. And even when you are in a deep deep sadness, you can be at your best and cheer everybody up and pull them up to your level…it&amp;rsquo;s something which is really unique.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;books-poems-thoughts-that-nourished-me&#34;&gt;Books, poems, thoughts that nourished me&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wild Geese, Mary Oliver&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Possibilities, Wisława Szymborska&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;320 (There’s a certain Slant of light,), Emily Dickinson&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;632 (The Brain – is wider than the Sky –), Emily Dickinson&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Just Beyond Yourself, David Whyte&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brainpickings.org/2020/10/21/14-years-of-brain-pickings/&#34;&gt;Choose Joy&lt;/a&gt;, Maria Popova&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;books&#34;&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;David Whyte, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/04/29/david-whyte-consolations-words/&#34;&gt;Consolations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Already Free, Bruce Tift&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Fear of Doing Nothing, Valery Hazanov&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Transcend, Scott Barry Kaufman&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nightwish&lt;/strong&gt;: helmed by Floor Jansen, greatest, most versatile singer alive.

      <title>Seeds: My First Collection of Poems</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/seed-poems/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 20 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/seed-poems/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/poem3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I began reading poetry in 2017 (with Mary Oliver’s Wild Geese as my gateway drug) but didn’t seriously start writing my own until early 2020. This was spurred in part by curiosity, though mostly it was desire: a desire to slow time in its tracks, and to give better attention to the daily minutia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once, I was in the MRI room of the hospital (where I work) waiting to start a child’s scan. The main operator – a friend of mine – walked in a few minutes later, plopped his things down, and settled himself into his chair. He seemed tired and somewhat disgruntled, and I asked him about it. “Nothing out of the ordinary,” he said. “Just another day! It isn’t Rome, that’s for sure (referring to our lab trip).”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I agreed, it was just another day, though comments like this tend to put me off. They suggest that what one has in front of them is insufficient; that life, unless experienced in ideal circumstances, is best resigned to the hand of time, to the false certainties of the future, while the ground beneath you is left fertile. Once the scanner was running, the technician drew out his phone, chuckled, and whispered to himself “Time to collect that time off again.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t long before COVID-19 began ravaging the world, leaving us without nothing more than slowed time, broken promises, and the minutia in its wake. What followed were weeks spent wandering. Daily I walked the same route on the same path by the lake, not really sure what to make of it all. So much of our thoughts hinge on the prospect of the future in the winter of our struggles, but that was no longer an option.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Writing poetry, then, became an act of survival and defiance against circumstance. It was the untarnished thread that pulled me through the despondence and existential loneliness that inevitably came to accompany my days. Often pulling the line on the other side was my dear Ukrainian penpal, Sasha. We connected online early in the pandemic via the first four lines of William Blake’s Auguries of Innocence:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class = &#34;poem&#34;&gt;&#xA;* To see a World in a Grain of Sand&#xA;* And a heaven in a Wild Flower&#xA;* Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand&#xA;* And Eternity in an hour&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I sent these lines not knowing how well they would capture the nature of our correspondence and the development of our companionship. We wrote and sent poems to each other daily, even hourly early on. Poems were our lifeline in the midst of the surrounding upheaval, our shared bed of infinities and eternities on which sand grains crystallized and wild flowers bloomed. It was because of her that I gave more attention and soul to my poems. Writing poetry then, too, was an act of love.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The result is this handpicked collection of 20 poems. Chosen are the ones I enjoyed writing most. They are the result of a continual attempt to make sense of and find meaning in 2020. They are also my way of cashing in on life without leaning on time collected and the precarious promise of the future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/poem2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/poem1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can freely download e-book and kindle versions to read on your devices &lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kQU0zJ7GaweMQVKy1KnJcSRn2BmUk6BJ&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want a paperback copy, you can purchase that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Seeds-Poems-Phil-Nguyen/dp/B08QQ5DK3S/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=&amp;amp;sr=&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; - the price ($5) covers the cost of printing it, with about a dollar going to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like writing poems because they force me to reconsider my relationship with the world, to see things in a new or rediscovered light. If any of these poems resonated with you, made you smile or feel inspired, less alone, and even second-guess what you thought you always knew, send me a message (nguy.philip at gmail.com) - I love hearing about how my work makes people think and feel (feedback is welcome too)! Or if you&amp;rsquo;d like, consider &lt;a href=&#34;paypal.me/nguyenhphil&#34;&gt;sending a coffee&lt;/a&gt; my way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>End of Day</title>

      <description>&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/XOrygf_iLhw&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the end of the day. You&amp;rsquo;re done with work, studies, dinner, dishes, laundry. Your dog, kids, and partner are asleep, no emails need to be answered, the house is silent. It&amp;rsquo;s only you, your mind, and time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Time clocks in at 10:58pm and tells you you&amp;rsquo;re wide awake. The only thing standing between you and tomorrow is your existential loneliness, that ominous, expansive companion who consistently makes his presence felt when the day no longer has any hold over you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You stare through your bedroom window and listen to your partner&amp;rsquo;s breath, your grounding force. Thoughts of the future dot your mind like stars in the sky, stories on candlelit nights, some fizzling out sooner than others, though one pulls you away from this earthbound reality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your hair is loose &amp;amp; scraggly, your face a reminder of physical determinism, your body a remnant of what was. Everything you&amp;rsquo;ve done will soon be forgotten. Everyone you love will soon be without you. Every part of your life will soon become no more than a trail of memories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A heaviness in your chest pulls you back to the bedroom. Your eyes are closed, your heart rate is soaring, and your cheeks are wet. This is it, you think. This is all there ever will be. You, your mind, and time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your dog makes his way under the groove of your arm and stays there. He sighs, licks your cheeks clean, looks in the direction of the window, and waits. 11:25pm. It&amp;rsquo;s the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/endofday.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Ici et Maintenant (Here and Now)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/ici/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am often thinking about the next thing and the big capital F future, but I finally feel like I’ve come to accept that this is now my life - grad school, learning, simple living. It&amp;rsquo;s the first time I feel free without needing to run or be in constant motion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s always been easier for me to throw myself into new situations rather than commit to a singular path. It was what I grew up with. To commit meant losing &amp;lsquo;options&amp;rsquo;, which younger me was unwilling to sacrifice, but really I was just scared. Scared of falling into the wrong job, relationship, life. Scared of wasting time and becoming someone who I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to become, even though I had only the slightest glimpse of what that was.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These fears are somewhat founded, but to live your life this way is to be trapped by stories that no longer serve you. The real, honest-to-truth freedom lies in committing to a path you have chosen and refined, even when things get hard and feel uncertain. It&amp;rsquo;s a road only you yourself decide to pave, without the full knowledge of where it may take you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m writing less but living more, saying yes and opening doors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m surfing the waves of singular moments and riding the rhythms of existence, wherever they decide to take me, without resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chasing sunrises and sunfalls, with a loaf of bread in my pack. Listening to that far inward call without looking back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even when we&amp;rsquo;re committed to a path we have to balance and resolve the competing desires that periodically punctuate our lives. Four weeks into my graduate program, I realized I had to surrender my less important but more immediately satisfying ambitions in order to focus on building the foundation from which the life I wanted could stand. Of course, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be in this program if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t at least partially interested in it either. The journey matters. It has to mean something to you. That&amp;rsquo;s how you get through the tougher days, without wanting to disengage and run away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The alternative is to live a divided life, at best. If it feels that way, commit to quitting and creating a new path, commit to exploring, commit to figuring out a better way to live it. Commit to something, but don&amp;rsquo;t oscillate. The most interesting, wide-ranging people are those who find ways to channel their multitude of interests, ability, and suffering into something uniquely theirs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some days I miss it, the familiar yearnings for elsewheres and foreign roads. They are still there if I dig deep enough, though in a different, more mature form. Rather than lead me to new vistas, they&amp;rsquo;ve begun to guide me toward richer experiences in what has become the daily. Whether it is with old friends and existing but fertile relationships, partially learned songs and shelved books collecting dust, pursuits that would have previously been uncommitted from when they inevitably grew difficult to chase, the roots I&amp;rsquo;ve developed are being embodied. Where they branch off to isn&amp;rsquo;t as important now as is embracing the seasonality of the currents, wherever they may lead me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ici et Maintenant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class = &#34;poem&#34;&gt;&#xA;* Some days are meant just to be&#xA;* Fully lived, existing, no trace of memories.&#xA;* Is it enough?

      <title>Dad and America</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/to-be-american/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 11 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/to-be-american/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My dad texted me “happy July 4th” the day of, and it prompted me to think about what it means to be an American.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dad grew up in post-war Vietnam and was relatively better-off than many of the kids around him thanks to my grandfather’s involvement with the U.S. as an intelligence operator (think liaison between the U.S. CIA and the Southern Vietnamese government). However, when the war ended, the Southern Vietnamese cut all of their ties with the U.S. due to safety concerns. It wasn’t long before Northern Vietnamese troops started pillaging homes, imprisoning, interrogating and torturing suspected freedom fighters, and violently enforcing the communist regime.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My grandfather began looking for ways to get the family out of the country. It took years before any solid leads were found, but eventually the gamble was made on a man who took Dad to the coast of Vietnam, where he was “packed like a sardine” on a tiny fishing boat and cast off into the ocean. It was too risky to bring the entire family, so they stayed while Dad left. He was no older than 10.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The boat drifted aimlessly at sea for 7 days. Then, on the 7th night, Dad heard a low whirring sound in the deafening stillness, and it grew louder, inched closer until suddenly he was engulfed in the bright beam of a floodlight. Above them loomed the large hull of a US Navy Destroyer. They brought the Vietnamese on board, fed them, and provided warm showers. They were safe, at least for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few days later Dad was sent to a refugee camp in Cambodia. He spent a few months there and was then sponsored to come to the US by a family in Michigan. He finished high school, moved out to California, met my Mom, had a brief stint in the Air Force, left, got married, had a daughter and a sometimes infuriating son, raised us alone after my Mom died of an aneurysm in the brain, I age 2, my sister 1, and the rest, as they say, is history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I asked him what he thought about the problems America is currently facing. While he was somewhat more complacent regarding his perspective on things and what could be done, he couldn’t deny the fact that the fate of this country rests in the hands of its people, and that the opportunity to make things better was always there, unlike in other countries. America had taken him in as a child and gave him the chance to build a life of his own. That was certainly worth celebrating.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”. That has always been the promised ideal for all Americans, however short we have fallen at times aspiring to these heights, particularly because of our ongoing struggle to expand the notion of what and who Americans are. Yet when considering the grander scope of history, the circle has widened to encompass more and more people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To be an American is to never lose sight of these ideals, and the fact that our democracy enables us to act in accordance with them. That freedom to act is the greatest privilege of all. It is the opposite of what psychologists call ‘learned helplessness’, which manifests as despondence, depression, and nihilism. It is the real reason to celebrate in hard times - the fact that we can fight for better, and care enough to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/photos/american.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Devotion</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/devotion/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is in reference to a trip I took shortly before the New Year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s the day I’m supposed to be camping in Joshua Tree, but I find myself driving up the coast instead, hunting for answers. Something is calling me north to Santa Barbara. It feels familiar, like a warm embrace from a distant friend, an aged habit that continues to linger, yet it remains entirely nameless. A ghost is whispering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I arrive, park in front of my old apartment complex, and shuffle up the steps to the second floor. The chalky blue paint and the unused pool; unit 79, once mine and the host of many firsts; unit 53, a dear friend’s, the place I received story, connection, and an unconditional heart. It was all still there, a collection of memories unchanged by the hand of time. On the way out, I catch my reflection in the pane of a window. What had changed was me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nostalgia begins to flood and take form as I walk the streets. I picture my first night in town, a room full of laughter, innocence, and naivety, boys stumbling toward their premature notions of manhood and adulthood, all accompanied by a bottle of Skyy. They each arrive at their own definitions, but what has been agreed upon is that it is a constant work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The old deli comes into view and snaps me from my reverie. I move closer and scan the storefront, but they aren’t there: The bullet holes are gone, erased. I think about the fickleness of memory, the way it filters and edits, censors and distorts. I think about the future generation of students, and about how May 23rd may be just another date to them, an issue best left to be made sense of by psychologists and politicians, a tragedy best forgotten. I think about those who were there, those who heard the screams and the sirens, the gunshots and the silence, the fear and the helplessness; I think about those who couldn’t say goodbye, those who had to bear the gravity of the aftermath, the rage, the grief, the loss, the emptiness. For them the scars will remain forever etched, the moments forever lucid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I go to the psychology building and think about how I am where I am. I think about the six-week summer meditation program, about Charles and Maria, Andre and Andrea, Mike and Kaita; I think about Alissa and the beliefs she instilled in me (energy is a non-limited resource!); I think about breathing and thinking, and I think about Naz. I think about the first time we meet in Applied Psychological Research, about the uniqueness of her full name, about mustering the courage to look into her dark eyes, those vast night skies in which I wanted to be the brightest and only star.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think about the first time I take molly and the reassuring words of Maria that convinced me I was in good company. I think about sitting on someone’s couch filled with joy, energy, and boundless love. Naz and Charles are curled under my arms, blissed out, in another dimension; I’m alert and wide awake, tripping but not yet falling, viscerally aware of the preciousness of the situation. There are attempts at conversation, but the words are fleeting and fail to cohere. People are fucking in the other room. I soak it all in and feel a deep sense of happiness. Smiles and laughter are the currency of the moment, and we were the lucky recipients.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think about the end of the night, about talking with Charles at my kitchen table until five AM, about the drug problems he had, about how vulnerable he must have felt telling it all to me. I think about how lucky I was to have ended up with such a strange and endearing group of cosmic configurations. I think about how grateful I felt to be able to call these people my friends.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I go to Freebirds and order the infamous nachos. Behind the counter, a look of recognition. It’s my mentee, a high school student I used to tutor. He flashes a grin at me and I wave to him. Four years have passed and he still remembers me. He’s in community college now. His life is better and he is well. My ego springs forward and wants to claim his success, but I know better and laugh at my selfishness. I bring my tray to a table and sit. Pictures of famous people vacate the wall, none of which I know. I imagine what it’s like to have mine up there one day, then take a bite. The nachos are still damn good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Downtown the coffee shop I used to frequent is gone. I walk around aimlessly past several adobe buildings and churches and wander into a familiar bookstore. A slim Patti Smith on the cover of a book catches me eye. I flip through the pages and find the word &lt;strong&gt;Devouement&lt;/strong&gt; – or rather, it finds me. It brings to mind Mary Oliver and the lovely whistler, a sense of connection. I purchase the volume and slip it into my bag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I make a final stop at the coast and stare out at the vast Pacific. Roses and rose petals litter the sand. It occurs to me that I have been chasing a trail left by my past selves, searching for a sense of unity and home. I pause and ponder the distance between who I was then, and who I am now. The waves continue crashing, and I imagine myself riding them, surfing the familiar edges with a little more grace, a little more humility, a little more peace of mind. Thoughts of the future silently slip away as I ease into the moment, as the moment seizes me. A ghost is whispering, telling me everything you need is here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/devotion.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Remember What You&#39;re Fighting For</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/remember_what_you_re_fighting_for/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 09 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/remember_what_you_re_fighting_for/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a lovely conversation with a woman named Natalie via &lt;a href=&#34;https://dialup.com/&#34;&gt;DialUp&lt;/a&gt;, an app that aims to revive the magic and intimacy of phone conversations. When we hung up, I looked out the window and had the thought that on the other side of these calls is always another human being.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It reminded me of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_truce&#34;&gt;The Christmas Truce&lt;/a&gt; between the Brits and the Germans in 1914 during WW1. On Christmas Eve the German soldiers began singing Christmas carols and invited the Brits to join them. The Brits were reluctant and cautious but eventually left their trenches and joined the merriment, shook hands, exchanged cigarettes, lit Christmas trees, and even played soccer with the Germans in No-Man’s land. It was a brief but powerful moment of realization for the men on both sides: in front of them, the abstraction of the forlorn enemy, the rabid monsters, &lt;em&gt;were just human beings, like them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the next few days, after the soldiers returned to their respective trenches, there was peace. Jokes were fired back and forth instead of bullets, and they thought to themselves “why are we killing each other?” A few days later the German troops were ordered by high command to fight again. So they told their new British brothers that they would start shooting at a specific time but shoot high so the Brits could take cover. No one got hurt, and another few days of peace went by. But British HQ realized what was happening and announced that if anyone was found fraternizing with the enemy would be court marshalled and executed. The generals got their way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This story parallels much of what is currently happening in the U.S., except that each of us is technologically equipped to be the general. A single tweet for instance has the power to ignite and inspire an entire nation toward a just cause. But it can also narrow our sense of shared humanity, distort reality, and throw us into &amp;ldquo;us&amp;rdquo; vs. &amp;ldquo;them&amp;rdquo; narratives, thus ultimately undermining the very ideals that we, hopefully, are striving towards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of this is to simply say that we must be vigilant in sifting through the constant barrage of messages being sent and amplified by the push of a single button, and to never lose sight of what it is that we truly are fighting for, now and in the future. We must ask ourselves: &lt;a href=&#34;https://tim.blog/2020/06/08/coach-george-raveling/&#34;&gt;are we having a conversation or a debate?&lt;/a&gt; Are we truly listening, or are we waiting for our turn to speak, for the perfect moment to interject with our premeditated rebuttals? In the words of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Baldwin&#34;&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/a&gt;, a writer &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2994/the-art-of-fiction-no-78-james-baldwin&#34;&gt;who had every reason to spend his life fueled by hatred of &amp;rsquo;the enemy&amp;rsquo;:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We’ve got to be as clear-headed about human beings as possible because we’re still each other’s only hope.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because in the end there are no sides. There is only us. &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/pale-blue-dot/&#34;&gt;All living together on a tiny pale blue dot suspended in a sunbeam.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/writing-love.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>On Attention and Cleaning Ones Ears</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/ears/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 11 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/ears/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past few weeks I noticed some pressure and discomfort on the inside of my right ear upon waking. I didn’t give it much thought and dismissed it as a minor annoyance, but then I realized that the volume on my computer had been gradually raised over the last few weeks, likely to compensate for an increased lack of hearing. This lead me to flush my ears out, and a funny thing happened.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Almost immediately I felt a sudden sense of clarity when the deed was done. The sound of liquid rushing through the pipes to my sink was distinctly sharper, almost too sharp for my newly clean ears to tolerate. I flushed the toilet once, and then again, afterwards feeling a shameless sense of joy in listening to the newfound range of frequencies that have always vacated my bathroom. Had all of this only been a flush away?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me that much of our lived experience is like this. Life is limited by what we are able to perceive, which itself is constrained by the capabilities of our brains and bodies. Yet within these biological parameters are worlds and landscapes that many of us have yet to explore, much less are even aware of. In my case, only when I had cleared&amp;ndash;quite literally&amp;ndash;the debris residing in my ear did the auditory nuance of my bathroom become perceptible. Out went the junk and in with what had always been there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly with certain mental states and frames of mind, it’s difficult to know what other worlds and possibilities exist unless you have an experience that takes you out of your habituated contexts. Reading and meditation are the sorts of activities that can remove you from your usual ways of being, though the resulting shift in perspective varies from person to person, and it occurs in small, snailish movements.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the experiential spectrum is something like a psychedelic journey. To echo a well-cited study (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3050654/&#34;&gt;aptly titled: Mystical-type experiences occasioned by psylocybin mediate the attribution of personal meaning and spiritual significance 14 months later&lt;/a&gt;) conducted by the scientific psychonauts at John Hopkins, well more than half of the participants reported that their psychedelic experience was among one of the five most “spiritually significant” and “personally meaningful” experiences of their lives at a 14-month follow-up. Other similar studies have observed lasting personality changes of up to a year, particularly on the dimension of “openness”. This is the sort of experience that fundamentally changes you, or at the very least it can provide the grounds for lasting change, especially when done safely and responsibly with a guide or therapist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of what you might call my own spiritual journey, I had a vague understanding of the connection between life, attention, and experience. Meditation certainly helped&amp;ndash;it was on a floor cushion after all where my initial interest in these ideas emerged&amp;ndash;but it wasn’t until my second psychedelic experience that the connection become tangible for me. About four hours in, I remember asking my roommate to walk with me to get tacos. I had been listening to classical music alone in my room while blindfolded, so I wanted to see and feel what was happening outside of my mind-–or more accurately, in what I felt was the space beyond the entity I called my ‘self’.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Words don’t do experiences like this justice, but the short walk to the restaurant was incredible. Everything felt more visceral and full of life. The sound of my roommate’s voice. The lights of the cars whirring by. The varying shades of darkness that were slowly being donned over Burlington. People who walked past me didn’t feel like strangers, and the usual sense of separation I felt between myself and the world was gone. “Is this really where I live?” I asked myself. What was once familiar had become novel and special again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the midst of this pandemic, it’s easy to lose ourselves and our sense of place in the noise and chaos. But beyond knowing enough to take proper action-–social distancing, proper hygiene, etc&amp;ndash;it’s all just build-up and needless debris that narrows and steers our attention away from what is essential, from what is possible, from what has yet to be seen but is always in plain sight. Perhaps what we as individuals need is a deliberate and steady reconfiguration of the self, a recentering of the spirit, a wider acceptance of what is, and a reorientation toward what can be. Our usual lives have been uprooted and disrupted, many more than others. But the same bare question remains open to all us: what now?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On my early morning walks through the woods, I am graced by the song of many birds. Often I try to locate them as I trek forward going nowhere in particular. Only when I have slowed down to a halt do the lovely whistlers emerge. Then, so too does everything else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/trees.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Graduate School</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/paths/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a long process of deliberation, but I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to attend graduate school at UVM.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t an easy decision. By the end of 2019 I felt incredibly burntout, mostly due to the fact that I had been taking two classes each semester in order to fulfill the math prerequisites, while also working full-time. I also had doubts about whether I actually wanted to do the program, which, when mixed with blind determination, makes for a deadly cocktail.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After winter break, I decided I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to take any more classes in the upcoming semester to recuperate and reflect. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve read, written, and journaled every day and have had extensive conversations with colleagues and friends. All of this lead me to the conclusion that I was trying to move through life too quickly. Even in the interim between the beginning of the semester and of a few weeks ago, I had applied for several jobs when I was supposed to be patiently reflecting. Luckily my gut knew that this was not what I wanted. All I needed was a breath of fresh air, a break from my own tumult.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With my mental in a better place, I was able to make an intentional decision, one free from any external pressure or momentum, one that was aligned with both my head and my heart. I promised myself that I would take things more slowly, even if it meant being in school longer, which isn&amp;rsquo;t so bad all things considered: I can focus on deeply learning the material by spreading my studies out across 3 years instead of 2, and I can continue working full-time, which means tuition will be covered. And I have more reason to stay in the beautiful VT.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In regards to my desire to help others in a meaningful way, that is something I am still figuring out. It&amp;rsquo;s certainly possible to steer my graduate efforts toward that end, but as for the specifics, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure yet as to how. As flight attendants so dutifully remind us during takeoff: I must first put on my own oxygen mask before I can be of service to others. That is something I am still learning. For now I hope my writing serves that purpose. I know for me it certainly has.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Superpowers</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/superpower/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/superpower/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A dear friend and I send each other long voice messages when we want to update each other on our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed each other at both our best and our worst. We&amp;rsquo;ve made ourselves vulnerable and have held each other&amp;rsquo;s pain through difficult times. We&amp;rsquo;ve offered one another various philosophies on how to live, and we constantly redefine and expand each other&amp;rsquo;s emotional maps, which has deepened our sense of the sort of relationships that are possible between ourselves, others, and the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve grown close to say the least, despite the literal ocean of distance between us. Perhaps what we have &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/10/13/mating-in-captivity-esther-perel/&#34;&gt;is because of it.&lt;/a&gt; Via Esther Perel:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Love rests on two pillars: surrender and autonomy. Our need for togetherness exists alongside our need for separateness. One does not exist without the other.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These paradoxical pillars of love extend to our friendships too. Distance and room for autonomy are necessary precursors for any thriving relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Surrender is essential too. Surrendering to our desire to be with the other. Surrendering to the vulnerability that follows after expressing what one wants and what one needs. Surrendering to the fact that people change. Surrendering to the thought that this other person may be full of quirks and idiosyncrasies that drive us crazy at times. Surrendering to the realization that in this short blink of existence, this other person, for whatever creed or reason, has decided not to shy away from what they have seen in us too. Surrendering to the fact that they have deemed us worth the trouble. Surrendering to the love that follows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a long winter hiatus, my friend caught me by surprise with this message. I recall telling her a month ago that I was again in the middle of carving out a new path. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what I was good at and could be good at and asked for her thoughts. Her response, slightly paraphrased:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;what is your superpower? Your whole being is a cure for loneliness&amp;hellip;truly. Like how you listen to people, it&amp;rsquo;s medicine for the soul. That deep understanding and great wish to understand the other. That supportive and positive state of mind you are in, the way you&amp;rsquo;re always smiling. And even when you are in a deep deep sadness, you can be at your best and cheer everybody up and pull them up to your level&amp;hellip;it&amp;rsquo;s something which is really unique.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hearing her say that made me incredibly happy and worthy of something. It also made me realize how profoundly your simple presence can affect someone, and this was a clear sign I&amp;rsquo;d be a fool not to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started thinking about ways of using this superpower toward a lasting endeavor. I know myself well enough to realize that her words reflect something deep in me, something I want to use to make the world a better place. But as to what end, I&amp;rsquo;m unsure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I ought to turn my mind inward and listen to what may be echoing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/superpower.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the airport, a young child from China sitting across me is working on a puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I watch as she pieces the parts together, then realize she’s missing the last one. It’s unclear if she herself has noticed yet, but I can’t help and feel that this is a manifestation of something that’s been on my mind. Something that seems incomplete, lacking clarity, but I’m unsure as to what.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Defeated, she scrambles back to her bag and turns her attention to her journal as I write in mine. Moments later, I find her sitting next to me, and she peeps a shy hi. I put aside my journal and greet her back, and she begins to show me pictures from her recent trip to Disneyland.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Her shyness quickly gives way to her colorful enthusiasm as she leafs through the pages, pointing out details about the Animal and Magic Kingdom, telling me stories about what this and that princess was like (“The one with long hair, Rapunzel!”), painting me a beautiful picture of how she views and experiences life. She asks me, “Do you know what kind of shoes &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; wears?”, referring to the boots of an icy character pasted in her journal. “Slippers!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She asks about my journal – which she claims is a diary – and where home is for me. She asks if Santa gave me the guitar I am currently carrying, and if I’ve been good or bad, or both. I tell her mostly good, and that Santa doesn’t believe in perfection anyways. She asks if I think Santa is real, how many diaries I have, how many pages I’ve written in it, and what I like to write about. The questions are endless, and so is the joy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A notification tells me my flight is departing from a different gate, and I tell her I have to go.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Where are you going?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Vermont, home.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Oh. What’s it like there?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Cold right now, but it’s a nice place.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Where I’m from it’s really hot!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Where I’m from we need some of that right now,” I reply with a smirk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She rummages through her bag and pulls out a small piece of chocolate wrapped in gold foil. “It’s not very healthy, but at least there’s an almond in the middle. Here! It’s one of my favorites.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I take it, thank her, and leave with hesitation as the hand of urgency moves me forward. Walking away, I look back and see her quiet father smiling at me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The missing piece to my puzzle has not been yet found. But I did gain something else, something even better than the answers ever could be: presence, unadulterated wonder, brief entrance to the wild landscapes that defined a child’s world, friendship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks little Emma.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/emma.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;More and more I find myself holding the pain of others. It’s a privileged place to be, to serve as the anchor that people hang onto when the currents of life become too tumultuous to bear, to guide through that necessary journey of self-annihilation before any growth may take place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I too am in the process of shedding old skin and paving new paths. The way forward is always dark and undefined, but something bright is coalescing on the edge of the horizon. So long as we continue walking, we are already there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/sky.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

She was studying in Russia at the time and had dreams of one day visiting America.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/alyona3.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/alyona4.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, I told her if she did come that we would have to meet, but neither of us anticipated the day would come so soon; a few months later she was accepted to study in the U.S. through the YEAR Program.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/alyona1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/alyona2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fast forward several more months and here we are in Boston, two individuals who share an endless fascination with the human experience, two curious souls with a desire to seize all the moments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Only later did we learn that perhaps it is the moments that seize us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although I think the start of a new year is arbitrary to say the least, it did prompt me to re-examine my values and the sort of life I want to create. In an effort to cultivate a more intentional and simple life, these are the things I want to be better at:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Daily meditation - This is the single practice and skill that has changed my life for the better. It has made me less emotionally reactive, more aware of my natural tendencies, and better attuned to the lives of others. But these are byproducts. The real reasons to meditate are to cultivate a better attention, to know how wild and crazy your mind actually is, to be okay with that, and to be alert to the fullness of life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Minimalism - I try to be deliberate about the things I own, but when you’re settled in a place for awhile, things tend to accumulate, things you don’t need but acquire anyways.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Digital minimalism - I’m fairly sparse in my social media usage already, but I’ve noticed I tend to use it compulsively when I’m stressed or bored (Twitter). It’s more a coping mechanism rather than intentional usage, and I want to change that. Better to view and use these platforms as tools rather than escapist sinkholes. I think I’ve been good with my Instagram though. The content is mostly a collection of ideas, stories, and writing with the aim of promoting a more meaningful and fulfilling existence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Knowing when enough is enough - I often joke that I’m the laziest ambitious person I know; I work hard on the things I care about, and do my best to prune out the things I don’t. Still, ambition is a double-edged sword that can leave a person in a miserable state of endless striving. I want to be better at slowing down, taking it easy, and having more fun in the process. Of course, this requires being clear about what one cares about, which is sometimes difficult to know when you’re always in the swing of things. The solution: take more walks. Use your PTO. Spend more time in solitude, away from external meaning-making systems. Reflect and refine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And I want to write more. Cheers to enjoying the ride.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/2020.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Loneliness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three weeks before Christmas, Doris Rafferty, an elderly woman of 82, admits herself to the hospital with complaints of a flutter in her chest. The doctors proceed to examine her but find nothing. No signs of pain, no physical symptoms, no problem to diagnose. By all medical measures, Doris is healthy. Three weeks later, she is still in the hospital, diagnosis free.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Doctor, can you give me a cure for loneliness?” Doris asks of her attending physician days before Christmas and her third expected discharge from the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite his well wishes, despite how badly he wants to cure her pain, he cannot. Her husband is dead. Her sense of home is gone. He cannot even prescribe her antidepressants because she fails to meet clinical criteria. The only solace he can offer her is temporary relief: he retracts his impending diagnosis and insists she spend her Christmas in the hospital ward, where company and gifts are abundant. Immediately her mood lifts. Her discharge date is buffered. No longer does Doris have to fib physical symptoms for emotional comfort, at least for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know how Doris feels; we all do. Loneliness: it is a condition that afflicts us all. Under its dark veil, life is drained of all color. It lingers and permeates, haunts and terrifies. At times it even moves, inspires, and magnifies the soul.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What is loneliness? What are its causes and how does it affect our health and wellbeing? And why do poets and songwriters seem to have a better understanding of it than scientists do? The poet David Whyte writes of the condition as “the doorway as to yet unspecified desire”; the writer Olivia Laing states it is “an inability, for one reason or another, to find as much intimacy as is desired”; the sociologist Robert Weiss defines it as “a chronic disease without redeeming features.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These definitions, while satisfactory in the poetic sense, fall short in capturing loneliness in its entirety. The first person to systematically explore it was German psychiatrist Frieda Fromm-Reichmann. Published in the late 1950s, Reichmann set the foundation for what may now be considered ‘loneliness studies’ in her trailblazing essay “Loneliness.” She begins the discussion by outlining the inherent difficulty in writing about such a topic: “Loneliness seems to be such a painful, frightening experience that people will do practically everything to avoid it.” Anyone who has ever felt lonely will understand that it is not an experience one wishes to relive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet this explanation doesn’t seem to capture why, upon self-reflection or inquiry, one is unable to recall their episodic loneliness, whether consciously or subconsciously. In consequence, loneliness has been neglected as a topic of scientific scrutiny, in part because everyone who has experienced it seeks to avoid its pangs, including psychiatrists and psychoanalysts: “This avoidance seems to include a strange reluctance on the part of psychiatrists to seek scientific clarification of the subject,” Fromm-Reichmann muses. Perhaps we reject these memories because they threaten our current state of wellbeing. This seems paradoxical though because we remember physically painful events in order to avoid them in the future. However, this doesn’t seem to be the case for loneliness despite the sensations of physical suffering often experienced by those in its grasp.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She proceeds to define different kinds of loneliness, with “real loneliness”, in contrast to “creative loneliness” or “temporary loneliness”, being “the exceedingly unpleasant and driving experience connected with an inadequate discharge of the need for human intimacy, for interpersonal intimacy.” Loneliness of the problematic variety, then, is linked to a lack of human intimacy, love, tenderness, and connection, the very things Doris Rafferty lacked outside the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fromm-Reichmann adds that it is a universal human need: “The longing for interpersonal intimacy stays with every human being from infancy throughout life; and there is no human being who is not threatened by its loss.” This idea is supported by psychologist John Bowlby’s theory of attachment. He postulated that every child is born with the biological need to form an emotional bond with a primary caregiver, typically the mother. This bond is crucial for the proper development and long-term wellbeing of the child, and when left unmet, problems arise: toxic relationships, delinquency, compulsive and addictive behaviors, impaired mental functioning. Loneliness often results from these problems, and the desire to escape it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“What does it feel like to be lonely? It feels like being hungry: like being hungry when everyone around you is readying for a feast,” writes Olivia Laing, author of The Lonely City. This hunger is a desire to fill the lack of attachment, that pervasive emotional void that distorts our social perceptions which further prevent us further from engaging in the very behaviors that would otherwise satisfy our need for intimacy. “It feels shameful and alarming,” Laing writes, “and over time these feelings radiate outwards, making the lonely person increasingly isolated, increasingly estranged.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This state of self-perpetuating social isolation is what John Cacioppo, social neuroscience professor at the University of Chicago, calls hypervigilance. This state of abnormally heightened arousal is experienced by the chronically lonely, and in it, unknowingly, the individual begins to see the world in increasingly negative terms. “They expect and remember instances of rudeness, rejection and abrasion, giving them greater weight and prominence than other, more benign or friendly interactions,” writes Laing. Thus, the cycle begins. The lonely individual becomes more vigilant, isolated, and withdrawn, without being conscious of it. The lonely become lonelier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the body begins to undergo a cascade of physiological changes. Loneliness disrupts homeostasis, our baseline level of internal equilibrium. Adrenaline and cortisol levels rise, immune functioning weakens. This is a normal and necessary response to stress; the body is fighting to return to its natural baseline. However, simmering in a constant state of flight-or-fight, the effects are detrimental. Loneliness elevates blood pressure, impairs executive brain functioning, diminishes quality of sleep, and promotes cardiovascular disease. And when loneliness is chronic, “when it persists for years and is caused by something that cannot be outrun,” as Laing puts it, the consequences are fatal: “Living with loneliness increases your odds of an early death by 45%,” Cacioppo states in his 2013 Ted Talk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is staggering in comparison to the other statistics Cacioppo lists: a 20% increase by obesity and a 30% increase by excessive alcohol consumption. Perhaps these are reasons why the former Surgeon General, Dr. Vivek Murthy, has sounded the alarm on the growing number of lonely people in America, going so far as to call it a public health crisis, an epidemic. “It turns out that loneliness is associated with a reduction in your lifespan that is as severe as the lifespan you see with smoking 15 cigarettes a day,” the general states in a 2017 CBS interview.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His assertion is supported by a large study conducted in 2018 by the health insurer Cigna. About 20,000 U.S. adults were administered the UCLA Loneliness Scale, the bread-and-butter metric of loneliness which asks participants to rate on a Likert scale how much they agree with statements such as, “I feel left out” and “People are around me but not with me”. A sum score above 43 is classified as loneliness, and the average score combining all age groups in the study was a 44, suggesting the rise of a loneliness epidemic. However, perhaps most surprising was that Generation Z (adults ages 18-22) averaged a loneliness score of 48.3, whereas “The Greatest Generation” (adults ages 72+) averaged a loneliness score of 38.6. As a group, the young feel more lonely than the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most people are quick to blame the differences on social media use for these disproportionate results, but it’s not quite so cut-and-dry. The study compared the loneliness scores of the digitally active Gen-Zers to their lesser active peers and found no differences, suggesting a more nuanced picture. Another contributing factor may be that the elderly tend to live in emotionally and mentally supportive communities while the young reside in a stage of life transitions and self-discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is important to emphasize that loneliness is different from being alone, as alluded to by Fromm-Reichmann. One can feel perfectly content in the midst of their solitude, while also feeling isolated in the throngs of a crowd. “[Loneliness] is not synonymous with being alone,” Cacioppo writes, “nor does being with others guarantee protection from feelings of loneliness.” It is the feeling itself that has the potential to destroy the body and mind, “the feeling that sets the whole grim cascade into motion,” Laing writes. The subjective experience matters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What Doris feels is not so different from what we feel when confronting the fact that something feels missing from our lives. Whether an episodic bout or a lifelong vacancy, we all know how it feels to be lonely. So long as we continue to live, loneliness will accompany us. And maybe that isn’t such a bad thing. Contrary to Weiss, perhaps there are redeeming features. “Loneliness is the substrate and foundation of belonging,” the poet David Whyte writes, “the gravitational field that draws us home.” Loneliness compels us to unite with one another, to seek belonging and acceptance among others amid the uncertainties of the world. It can give us the courage to beckon for that which we all need and desire to thrive: love. “I am alone,” Whyte concludes, “therefore I belong.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Loneliness is collective,” writes Laing. “It is a city,” one which we all inhabit. We are therefore obliged to take care of each other; to accept and be kind to one another. “We are in this together, this accumulation of scars, this world of objects, this physical and temporary heaven that so often takes on the countenance of hell.” But it is a hell we do not have to endure alone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there is no singular cure for loneliness. But there is us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class = &#34;poem&#34;&gt;&#xA;* It&#39;s hard to believe that there&#39;s nobody out there&#xA;* it&#39;s hard to believe that I&#39;m all alone&#xA;* at least I have her love, the city she loves me&#xA;* lonely as I am, together we cry&#xA;* &amp;nbsp;&#xA;* –Under the Bridge, The Red Hot Chili Peppers&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/lonely-walk.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>An Ode to Young Adulthood</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/ode-to-adulthood/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s this drawing of a banana. Toward the stem it is fresh, premature, and budding with potential; toward the other end it is weathered and well-defined, filled with the hard-earned sweetness and history that a full life bestows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two dashed lines split the picture into thirds, and middle age is the centerpiece. Before it, the world pulls you in with its long and wide arms, with its promises of invention and discovery, grievance and uncertainty, joy and adventure; afterward, the world opens itself up again, only to allow you to return that which you have reaped.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Along the leftward line is where we – the transitory adolescents, the precocious rebels, the wannabe adults, the adults in denial – tread, that unmarked territory in which adulthood takes its shape. We’re not as settled as the middle-aged seem to be, but we’re not so volatile anymore either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hangovers still leave us with the memories we had hoped to create. Bedtime is now a welcome luxury, though we desperately yearn for someone to share our dreams with. Wise is something of a compliment, though we prefer to be woke instead. Our wallets are slim, but that doesn’t concern us; we remain rich in the currency of time, even if we aren’t yet its best consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The brimming horizon of the future is within our line of sight, though what illuminates the long nights are the incandescent friendships of days long gone by. We don’t yet know how to navigate the slippery slopes of love, but we wouldn’t ever consider any other endeavor to be worthy of our youth. Like gamblers betting on hope, we swing precariously from one moment to the next, only vaguely aware of the consequences of our actions. Slightly jaded, the thrill isn’t something we live for anymore, but it still has the ability to awaken the younger part of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And when that happens, should we have the sense to hang onto it for as long as possible, we make room for the beautiful to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/banana.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In playful response to an article posted on The Atlantic, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/01/ode-to-middle-age/603067/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;An Ode to Middle Age&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m finally finished with the semester. Soon I’ll be heading home to see my parents, camp in Joshua Tree National Park, and soak in the California sunshine. The break is much needed, as is some perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lazy list of notable things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I applied to the Masters in Complex Systems and Data Science program at UVM.&lt;/strong&gt; This was a long process, mostly because I desire the kind of work that involves making connections with others, deep conversation, and facilitating personal transformation, but also because I was riddled with fear and self-doubt. All in all, I think I made the right choice given my current skillset and circumstances. Worst case scenario, I leave with well-developed computational skills, which would be beneficial if I wanted to pursue a PhD in Clinical Psychology, an option I am still considering for the future. Best case scenario I leverage my technical competencies to do social good. I’m fairly certain though that what brings me fulfillment is human connection and storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My relationship with my sister improved.&lt;/strong&gt; It wasn’t bad or negative before, but we formed a deeper bond through the various 1- and 2-hour conversations we had about school, family, and life in general. Often it is with your siblings that you have the longest relationships of your life, so it’s gratifying to know that we’re both making an effort to nurture it. She&amp;rsquo;s matured a lot, and I’m proud of the person she is becoming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wrote a letter of recommendation.&lt;/strong&gt; Someone I work with asked me to write her a letter of recommendation for graduate school. I was surprised at first, but when she told me why she had asked me, it made sense: I had taken the time to learn about her on a deeper level. I probed her brain; I talked to her about neuroscience and philosophy and sent her nerdy articles; I distracted her from doing actual work while asking about what she really cared for. This is a natural tendency of mine, especially with people who share similar interests. It&amp;rsquo;s fun to get to know people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I built an app and learned MATLAB.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I learned how to make dough and samosas.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I dated and survived more shipwrecks of the heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I maintained my foreign friendships and made a new one with a person from Québec.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I camped with my friend Jess whom I hadn’t seen since I moved to Vermont 2 years ago.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wrote some poems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I became a runner.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And my favorite things I consumed:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kameli.net/~raimu/rnd/ted-chiang-story-of-your-life-2000.pdf&#34;&gt;Story of Your Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Ted Chiang. Just read it. Chiang is a mastersmith of ideas and fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npr.org/2018/02/03/582968706/i-wrote-this-book-because-i-love-you&#34;&gt;I Wrote This Book Because I Love You&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Tim Kreider. Probably the best book I read this year. Kreider writes several essays that illuminate the joys and sorrows of human relationships and living. He&amp;rsquo;s the charming guy you want to be around at a bar; he&amp;rsquo;s also the sort of friend you want to have for the rest of your life. This book is a close surrogate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://timkreider.com/essays-cartoons/we-learn-nothing/&#34;&gt;We Learn Nothing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Tim Kreider. More essays, though broadly focused. My favorite is &lt;a href=&#34;https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/30/the-busy-trap/&#34;&gt;Lazy: A Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32620333-how-to-fall-in-love-with-anyone&#34;&gt;How to Fall In Love With Anyone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Mandy Len Catron. There&amp;rsquo;s a recurring theme here. Anyways, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the viral essay &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/style/modern-love-to-fall-in-love-with-anyone-do-this.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;To Fall In Love with Anyone, Do This&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; at the NYT, grab a cup of tea and do that now. Then read her book, which explores the various narratives that have lead to our modern definition of love.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/08/nyregion/auschwitz-love-story.html&#34;&gt;Lovers in Auschwitz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://poets.org/poem/you-cant-have-it-all&#34;&gt;You Can’t Have It All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a poem by Barbara Ras. For me, a reminder to let go of the things I can&amp;rsquo;t change, and to be grateful for what is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/six-weeks-100s-miles-hours-glorious-boredom-japan/&#34;&gt;The Glorious, Almost-Disconnected Boredom of My Walk in Japan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pbs.org/show/college-behind-bars/&#34;&gt;College Behind Bars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Lynn Novick. A powerful documentary highlighting the redemptive potential of education and people who are willing to give others a second chance. PLEASE watch this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yit1OqUfMg&#34;&gt;Delicate and Volcano&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Damien Rice. Chilling performance by a true artist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USom8PhOXgs&#34;&gt;The Trapeze Swinger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a cover by Gregory Alan Isakov. Originally sang by Iron &amp;amp; Wine, I actually like GAI&amp;rsquo;s version better. The song itself feels like a parable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://paulgraham.com/vb.html&#34;&gt;Life is Short&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; by Paul Graham. I revisit this essay often when I feel indecisive about things, or am riddled with thoughts of the future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And life goes on. See you all in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/fall2019.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No longer can the tension be held - the line has already snapped. Ruled by avarice, self-concern and profit, we have neglected the consequences of our collective actions for far too long, and are now witnessing the global repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The signals were sent long ago. The animals continue to wonder where their kin have gone; the tallest trees and eldest trees watch as their siblings are amputated and felled alongside their once abundant home; the atmosphere endures as we demand of it to withstand even greater heights of human progress. But at what cost? That much is clear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can’t continue to mire ourselves even more deeply into the shadows of our own creation. We can’t continue riding high on the default setting of our minds, drifting along unaware, unconscious, asleep, ignorant, and blind while the rest of the world suffers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The greatest product of four billion years of evolution needs help. It isn’t the trees, the animals, or the planet. It’s us. We need better stories to live by.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chaos blooms like a cosmic wildfire. The place we call home is burning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/overstory.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>A Recent Trip</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/trippy/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past Sunday, I tried magic mushrooms for the first time. It wasn’t much – around a gram or so, which is a bit less than what &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/press_releases/2006/griffithspsilocybin.pdf&#34;&gt;this paper&lt;/a&gt; suggests for someone of my body weight – but it was enough to dig up some insights about myself and the nature of the mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning there was nothing. I had just eaten the mushrooms –  they felt like dried mango slices, though without any of the succulence and sweetness – and was sitting on a floor cushion in my friend’s apartment, meditating and waiting to be flooded by the expected perceptual disturbances – visual distortions, heightened bodily sensations, dissolution of the self, the initial nausea that normally follows their raw ingestion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until two hours later, after I had asked my friend to drop me off at my apartment, that I began to feel the mental reverberations. Slowly two worlds began to emerge. The first was one in which everything was happening to me, to the “I” I identified myself with in conversation and daily life, to what Buddhists would call the ego. In this world we are the center of the universe, the master of our experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the second world the ego ceased to exist. Who “I” was became irrelevant and meaningless. Any sense of time and temporal experience was seamlessly framed in the present moment. There was only consciousness and its contents. I was no longer separate from the universe; I was an indistinguishable part of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I cued one of my favorite songs - Blackbird by Tash Sultana - as I traversed the two landscapes. The usual mental clutter and noisy digressions that frequently accompanied my days gently dissapated. It felt as if a thin veil or fog were being lifted from the forefront of my mind, and the residual effect was one of growing clarity and freedom. The boundary between myself, Blackbird, and the world continued to dissolve. I felt able to freely move into and out of the rhythms and melodies of the music, as if the song itself were an open ocean one can freely choose to enter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t entirely removed from reality. I was still highly functional, even more so perhaps. Free from all my usual neuroses and thoughts of the future, what naturally followed was a boundless sense of joy, wonder, and connection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An hour later I went for a walk by the lake. Everything seemed more colorful than usual, despite the overcast skies. The trees and plants shimmered with aliveness, and I felt especially confident and unself-conscious while looking at various strangers. I smiled at them when they looked at me, and when they smiled back, I cherished the simple act as if it were the last smile in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later I ran into three young people trying to climb one of the sculpted stones by the water. I couldn’t help but laugh at the pure innocence and playfulness of the situation. One of them was on the ground with her legs raised in the air, wobbling and unsteady like those of an overused stool, serving as the base from which the others would ascend. My laughter came out fully and abruptly, free from any hesitation or awareness of social decency. I surprised even myself, though it was short-lived: without much effort I quickly fell back into the absurdity of the moment. The three then looked at me, smiled, and laughed along.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Walking back home, the effects of the psilocybin began to wear off. The vibrancy of my surroundings faded back to their usual hues, though my uplift in mood was still present. I knew I hadn’t taken enough to experience complete ego dissolution or any sort of astronomical mind-bending, but there was a distinct qualitative difference in how I viewed the world, one I hoped would have some permanent bearings. Already the future was returning, but for that I was grateful too. Any sense of struggling for the unreachable had slipped away, like snow melting on alpine in Spring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am now thinking of David Foster Wallace’s commencement speech. Two young fish are swimming along when they encounter an older fish swimming the other way. The older fish says to them, “Morning boys, how’s the water?” The younger fish ignore him and swim on, then turn to each other and say, “What the hell is water?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What the younger fish are unaware of is the nature of the place that they have lived for their entire lives. They lack any knowledge of its geography, currents and contours, which is fine if you’re a fish. But for us, it’s consequential to be unaware of the water we are swimming in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the past few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling with indecisiveness. It was unclear to me whether or not I should continue taking classes in order to apply to UVM’s M.S. program in Complex Systems and Data Science, pivot into a full-time online web development course, or do something completely different. I knew that something was bothering me on a fundamental level, but I couldn’t get a good grip on what it was. All I knew was that I felt deeply dissatisfied and unfulfilled most days. I was in a constant state of worry and uncertainty, and I couldn’t focus on anything. Reading, playing outside, and even spending time with friends was no longer enjoyable. If I wasn’t doing something that contributed or related to figuring out my career, then it didn’t feel worth doing at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is clearly a destructive mindset to be in, yet it was difficult to think and act in any other way. The alternatives felt faint and out of reach. I was mired in the slog of my own sorrows, and I was unable to see that the lifeline was hanging right in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the fish story, Wallace states that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“the most obvious, ubiquitous, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see and talk about.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The thing that seems most obvious of all is what is right in front of us; how we see and move about in the world, how can this be any different from what it is, from how we perceive it to be? Changing our perspectives and attitudes isn’t easy, but it isn’t impossible either. Things can be different, if only we attempt to look at and pay attention to the narratives and dramas that dictate our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s been five days now since my modest trip, and I can honestly say I’m in a better place. The current psychedelic research finds that there can be lasting positive effects on one’s personality after a trip, specifically on the dimension of openness. For me, joy and playfulness seem to come more easily; I feel alert and alive and am burning with creative energy; the days seem lighter, more open, and I take things less seriously than I need to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t take a mushroom trip to glean these insights, but I’d be lying if I said that psilocybin didn’t play a role in redefining my convictions and revitalizing my sensibilities. I’m convinced of their therapeutic potential, given that one uses them intentionally.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of happiness is about being present enough to recognize what is already in front of you, choosing how to behave and react, and allowing yourself to step through the open door of the world when it presents itself. Any compound, practice, or experience that removes you from your default setting has the power to help you see it more clearly. But the secret is that the door is always there, open, available, and ready to enter at anytime. Sometimes, though, one needs a capped friend to prod them through.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/trippy.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cemeteries are strange places, quiet and empty yet abundant and full of character. Even in death, we continue to exert our presence upon the land, to desire and make ourselves stand out among the trees and animals by erecting these faceless stones amid the crowd of the wild. “I was here,” they say, “once a member of the living.” Even in death, the human ego seeks and pleads to the world, “don’t forget me.” But the trees and animals know better and laugh. They know that a tombstone among graves is just a stone among rocks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/cemetary.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Rome</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/rome/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/rome/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently went to Rome, and it was nothing short of stimulating, sensuous, and overwhelming. From the minimal use of ingredients in Italian cuisine to the incredible works of Michaelangelo and other Roman artists, everywhere you went, everything you touched, tasted and smelled, everything you experienced, it all seemed like some part of a grand plan aimed at steering one’s senses toward a deeper appreciation and understanding of beauty and aesthetics. The city was a living, breathing work of art, an astounding pillar of human ingenuity that left me wide-eyed and dumbstruck.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, it was there that for the first time I felt homesick while traveling. The feeling hit me when my friends and I began imagining what it’d be like to live in Rome. It didn&amp;rsquo;t take long for me to come to the conclusion that I much preferred the quiet and serene nature of Vermont. Rome, as one friend put it, was a zoo. It was loud, constricting, and touristy. Some people may enjoy this kind of environment, but I thrive in smaller cities and places with a more communal feeling. Rome also lacked the particular kind of wildness that I’ve come to love, find solace in, and be humbled by while living in the green mountain state.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having a sense of home is a relatively new concept for me. What did it mean to miss home? Perhaps what I missed wasn’t Vermont, but rather the life that I’ve built over the past year and a half. The routines, the familiarity, going to Mag’s cafe to read, work, and write, walking up the Burlington bike path by Champlain lake. The verdancy and birdsong. The numerous dates and unrequited loves. My colleagues who double as my friends. All of this was home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Upon closer introspection, I also realized I didn&amp;rsquo;t just miss home. I was plagued by restlessness, confusion, uneasiness, and I only had faint clues as to why. The inner home was showing signs of wear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-past-year&#34;&gt;The Past Year&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Step back a year and I was starting to work on the prerequisite coursework for UVM’s Complex Systems and Data Science graduate program. My original goal in pursuing this program was to continue working on the ABCD Study as a full-fledged researcher, but also to gain an in-demand set of technical skills in case my intentions changed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As time progressed, it became clear to me that the reality of working in academia was significantly different from how I initially imagined it to be. In most cases academic researchers aren’t obligated to only their research. They also had to apply for grants, cater their papers to specific academic journals, navigate university politics, teach and mentor students, run their own lab, and relentlessly fight for tenure. Not that all of this is undesirable, but it makes the research seem secondary. Maybe it was all worth it for the opportunity to do science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seemed rational then to find out if I’d actually enjoy doing the research itself. I reached out to my PI and asked if I could work on a research project under her guidance, and she graciously granted me the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I didn’t enjoy it. I bemoaned the literature reviews, academic writing, and how little inherent feedback I received from the work. I never really knew if I was moving in the right direction, and what was deemed a discovery was less than thrilling to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I was missing the bigger picture, I thought. They weren&amp;rsquo;t merely hunting for p-values; they were asking and refining questions, proposing and testing hypotheses, defining and advancing science. My optimism was often revived when I reminded myself of this. But when it came to actually doing the work, my mind was resistant and someplace else. Perhaps I liked the idea of becoming a scientist more than actually being a scientist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I trudged through and finished the project, but by semester’s end, my thoughts had grown cynical and indifferent as my curiosity and general enthusiasm for science waned. I was likely burning out at this point. In addition to the research project, I was still studying for calculus and statistics while also working full time on the study. A break was called for. Fortunately, the lab was headed to Rome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;ohbm&#34;&gt;OHBM&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We went to Rome not just to travel, but to also attend the 2019 OHBM (Organization for Human Brain Mapping) conference. It was the perfect opportunity to gain some perspective on the field of neuroscience, and whether or not I would fit in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I skipped most of the keynotes and lectures, partly out of disinterest, but mainly because I wanted to interact with the scientists themselves. I wanted to learn about their lives and what drove them into academia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, I spent a lot of time with the graduate students and postdocs who were already in my lab. Beyond the scope of email, small talk, and the tasks I’d offered to help them with, we didn’t talk much or know each other well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like any other job, they said, being a scientist has its ups and downs. It’s true that the common perception of being a scientist consisted of long hours and an absolute dedication to one’s work. One anecdote involved a woman who was incredibly successful by academic standards, yet it was said that she hadn’t seen her young son in over three months. Apparently he had drawn her a picture and would only show it to her if she came home. I don’t know the full extent of their circumstances, but it seemed like a strange and disturbing cry for attention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, there were also scientists who seemed to lead rich and fulfilling lives outside of academia. Max and Shana, the two postdocs in my lab, said if they couldn’t be successful working an average of 45 hours per week, then academia just wasn’t worth it. They cared about other things too. Of course, they worked their asses off when they had to, but they also knew how to shift gears when needed. “Work hard, play hard” was their motto, which was nice to witness and be a part of in the various outings we had in Rome. It painted a different picture of what a scientist could be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I presented my poster on the third day of the conference. I was a bit nervous because I knew there were some shortcomings in my methods, and the premise of my project was fairly basic, but it was good practice to show my work, and I received great feedback from kind postdocs and graduate students. Being a research assistant granted me license to embrace being an amateur. Afterwards, I spent the rest of my time in the city with my fellow RAs and occasionally alone, eating, reading, chatting, and writing. It felt good to be done with the project. There was a lot to think about. (Like when I would cut my atrociously long hair, the only experiment I could draw a conclusion from!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/rome.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;budapest&#34;&gt;Budapest&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last week of my trip was spent in the lovely Budapest, visiting a friend whom I hadn’t seen in two years. I had visited before, but it was during this second trip that I came to appreciate the city for what it offered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Rome, Budapest feels more open and European. The city coexisted with the natural scenery. Trolley tracks and bike paths lined the streets. The friendly but mind-your-own-business Eastern European persona was stark. It was a much needed escape from the Roman zoo.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I spent some time reading, writing, and hanging out with my beloved friend, but mostly I just looked. At the people. At buildings and at storefronts. At my mind and my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One day an older couple from Israel noticed me doing this, “nothing”, outside a small cafe by the Hungarian National Museum, and we had a long and thoughtful conversation about it. It occurred to me that most people don’t really do this, just looking at things and seeing them as they are. The wife, a teacher at a Waldorf school, thought it was an incredibly important skill to teach her students in a world where attention is exploited for profit. I replied that it may not be the most exciting thing to do, &amp;ldquo;nothing&amp;rdquo;, but it provided fertile ground for creativity, serendipity, and reflections to grow, which actually makes it pretty fun. And sometimes a connection you didn’t see before may suddenly and sometimes wildly emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;home&#34;&gt;Home&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can’t do everything in life, so you have to pick and choose what’s important to you, and unapologetically prune everything else out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scientists with balanced lives have their priorities in order. It’s perfectly fine to have science define the entirety of one&amp;rsquo;s life, so long as it was a deliberate decision. But this perched image of the heralded scientist can be misleading and harmful to those who want to work as a scientist, but find fulfillment and meaning in other things as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Walking yesterday down by Champlain Lake, I realized that I had been accompanied by an awful, dreadful feeling of existential angst for nearly every day over the past 3 months. In this state of mind, everything I tried or worked on that wasn’t related to “figuring it out” became a distraction. Something bad. Unproductive. A waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was clear that something needed to change, both in environment and mindset, in priorities and values.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I want to become a scientist anymore, at least in the conventional, academic sense.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I do want is to be curious. For my brain to feel alert and turned on. For my days to be filled with a sense of wonder, vitality, awe, fascination, and astonishment. I want to “choose a soul that is alert and wide awake,” in the words of the writer Jedidiah Jenkins. This requires dismantling and redefining what work means to me. It requires reexamining the sort of life I want to live.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking forward, there are a few leads I’d like to follow. It’s gonna take some work. But life’s too short to compromise for anything else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/throwing.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Bearing Witness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are 16 of us nestled in the sunlit alcove of the church. I look at the stranger sitting on a navy-blue cushion before me and wonder what she is thinking about. She smiles at me, and I smile back. We introduce ourselves and make small talk, as does everyone else and their adjacent stranger. The bell rings, and the room falls into silence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We turn our gaze to Mike, the PI of the study. His voice is gentle and reassuring, like that of a breeze in the wind, and I find myself getting lost in his intense blue eyes. Then the instructions come: look into your partner’s eyes for the next few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My partner and I fidget and reposition ourselves on our increasingly stiff and uncomfortable cushions. Our eyes dart toward one another’s, then to the ground and to other objects in the room, then back again to our respective irises. Chocolate brown staring into forest blue. She smiles at me, and I smile back. It is clear we have never actually looked at anyone like this before. I imagine us as two strangers waltzing in a burning room.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A minute or two passes before the discomfort is overtaken by a growing sense of awe and openness. The longer I look at my partner, the more I see beyond the narrow horizon of her eyes. She is no longer just a stranger before me. She is a multitude of malleable identities and stories, a twisted thread of immutable pasts and yet-to-be-had futures, a long line of unfulfilled promises and unfulfilling heartbreaks, an unimaginable plane of N dimensions, an infinity no mathematician could ever tame, prove, or understand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Searching for certainties is no longer an option on the vast plains of vulnerability. My eyes rest and release the desire to run. There is nowhere left to go or hide. What remains is the raw openness of experience, of bearing witness, of measuring moments not by the hands of the hour, but by the rapid echoes of our beating hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/clouds.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>The Pale Blue Dot</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Propelled into space in 1977, NASA’s scientific objective of launching the Voyager I was to photograph the planets of the outer solar system. They expected the spacecraft to seize its functioning upon reaching Saturn. Yet function it did, defying and continuing to defy expectation up to this day, still traveling at 40,000 miles per hour, somewhere at or beyond the edges of our cosmic horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the Voyager passed Saturn, Carl Sagan – astronomer, cosmologist, astrophysicist, lover and communicator of science – requested that NASA turn the cameras back toward home. He wanted a picture of Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many in the Voyager program were supportive of the idea, but there were concerns about the practical costs of following through with Sagan’s vision. I picture the pragmatists wondering, “Are we really going to do this? Is this really worth the effort?” Of course, Sagan was well aware that his request would fulfill no scientific objective. But he had more poetic ambitions, for knowledge and progress is limited without a sense of perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can only imagine the poetic candor, timeliness, and confidence Sagan must have exuded while attempting to convince the NASA administration of his wish. On Valentine’s Day of 1990, from 3.7 billion miles away, the Voyager captured this photo of Earth, immortalized by Sagan as the “Pale Blue Dot.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am thinking of this picture now in light of the current cultural, political, and global tensions we are all facing. I am thinking of Sagan’s arresting reflection that should reorient even the most cynical of us:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;iframe width=&#34;100%&#34; height = &#34;400&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EgAnh8OB83U&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video player&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it’s different. Consider again that dot. That’s here. That’s home. That’s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ‘superstar,’ every ‘supreme leader,’ every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there — on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner. How frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity — in all this vastness — there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves. The Earth is the only world known, so far, to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment, the Earth is where we make our stand. It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we’ve ever known.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That’s here. That’s home. All of it. A tiny pale blue dot. A mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/Pale_Blue_Dot.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Shoreless Seeds and Stardust</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/shoreless/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I ventured out onto the lake today, this time beyond the frozen crest that marks the boundary between bay and lake, contemplating the last line of Maria Popova’s Figuring:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“What will survive of us are shoreless seeds and stardust.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My saunter figured into a sprint as the mountains came into view, and the voices behind me became no more than whispers. Minutes later I ran into a couple playing in the snow. We were the only three out on the edge of the lake’s center, three islands happy just to be. I smiled at them and carried on ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ski tracks and foot trails slowly gave way to the unsentimental forces of snow and wind, erasing any trace of human curiosity, ingenuity, legacy, as I moved further from civilization. I reached the center and turned my gaze toward shore, then to the skies above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact that, by some collision of chance and choice, we exist in this cosmic blink of a moment, so short yet so sweet, removed me from my thoughts and dropped me into the full emptiness surrounding me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Standing on the expanse, alone though occasionally filled with images of another, alone yet accompanied by the unique neuronal flutterings that have mapped onto my brain the contours of a newly discovered body and mind, I thought of how easy it would have been to ascribe my good fortune to the whims of an all powerful force. This beautiful impulse toward certitude is a defining feature of our species.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But then I took a breath and remembered there exists a narrative more compelling than man-made stories predicated on fear of the afterlife. One only has to look up at the stars.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There will be a day when we close our eyes for the final time, and return to that bright void from which we all came, forever constellating and transmuting, forming and reforming, dancing and figuring on the thread of eternity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What will survive of us are shoreless seeds and stardust.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/frozenlake.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We met in the biting winter nights of my service year in New Hampshire. I listened with full attention as she illuminated the nuances of a world I thought I knew with the written word, hers, words that continue to remind me I am never truly alone, words that continue to show me the world is always at offer to the playground of my imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later, when faced with the task of figuring what direction my life would go next, she visited me in Spain and reminded me not to worry. &amp;ldquo;Things will take the time they take.&amp;rdquo; Saint Augustine followed many roads before he became Saint Augustine. It is all a journey, she said, a long, wide, and deep dive into the unfathomed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She also told me there are certain moments in life that cry out to be fulfilled, like telling someone you love them. I followed her word when that moment came for me. The woman, someone who cherished August blackberries, someone I loved dearly, gave me a box full of darkness in return. I learned only later that this, too, was a gift.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She came again when, during a morning walk down by the lake, I heard the call of wild geese, harsh and exciting, high in the clean blue air. I had been preoccupied with finding a sense of place, a sense that I belonged in the family of things, of knowing what to do next. I turned my gaze toward the geese, and my problems hushed their determined utterances. I watched the geese fly across the open sky, losing all sense of time, and when they flew beyond the range of my vision, I was inhabited by a lighter sense of being. I had taken flight with the geese, or rather, they had taken me. They reminded that I was an animal among animals, a lucky collection of stardust, something alive and wonderfully capable of experiencing the shared wonders of existence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I and many others will continue to feel the echoes of her singular devotion to her one wild and precious life. Even darkness can be a gift, a fire that awakens the sleeping soul, a light that guides us to our higher selves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To Mary Oliver, for teaching me that the sacred is always within reach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/maryoliver.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We sift through life without any compasses to guide us through the messy unknown, like aimless treasure hunters searching for diamonds in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The unknown scares us. We&amp;rsquo;re not comfortable immersed in its infinite expanse. Maybe this is why the human brain has evolved the ability to construe stories from unrelated anecdotes and scattered thoughts: we find comfort in connecting the dots, we tell ourselves everything happens for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stories provide our lives a sense of coherence, a hedge to prop ourselves on in the face of uncertainty. Sometimes they make things more beautiful, sometimes they prompt us to act; often times, they leave us wondering. &amp;ldquo;She likes me––right?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Life will always present us with opportunities that have the potential to profoundly alter our course along its river. It may be a person we meet, a change of job or city, a sobering rejection, a desire for more out of life. A cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These events are no more than events in and of themselves. But perhaps more beautifully, if we allow them to be, they are the unexpected serendipities that shape who we are, and who we become.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Life is an edgeless marble; serendipity gives it form. What was once meaningless becomes something of impossible importance. The stagnant becomes animate, looks natural and feels seamless, sings and breathes and dances to the songs of existence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Serendipity gives us permission to own a small part of life. It lets us claim this unusual sense of being, this constellating moment in time, this shifting tide that challenges our every sensibility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/scoutandco.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Forgiveness</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/forgiveness/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Forgiveness moves us toward a better future by inviting us to look at the past, at the unrelenting, painful ghosts that continue to permeate and darken each of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we need to feel rage, to tussle with guilt, to fall into our sorrows before we can forgive. No, forgiveness is not about avoiding these emotions. Rather, forgiveness asks us to show up daily with unwavering courage, compassion, receptivity, and kindness. It asks us if we are ready to build the bridge on which only we can cross in order to move beyond our past selves. Forgiveness is answering the call for a spiritual freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Forgiveness is a process. We know intellectually why we should forgive, but Truth is something that must be felt within our bones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Forgiveness is not easy. It takes work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Forgiveness does not always mean to let the other back into our lives. We may still declare, “I do not want you here. I do not want you in my life.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is the release of our psychic terrors; it is a letting go of the anger, rage, and suffering we have brought onto ourselves under the guise of their name. Forgiveness moves past victimhood and emboldens action. Forgiveness is ultimately for the forgiver.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Forgiveness asks us to let go of the pain we’ve held onto so long. It asks us to realize our own power. It asks us to make room for love. It asks us to embrace what is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Forgiveness asks us if we are ready to live again. It asks us if we are ready to risk getting hurt again in order to participate in the game of life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/forgive.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Feelings</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Feelings are fleeting by nature, like the passage of clouds on a warm summer day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Though too often we wear them like immutable masks and declare, &amp;ldquo;This is me. This is all I will ever be.&amp;rdquo; Sad. Resentful. Despondent. Happy. In truth they are masks, transient facades that hide a more true and vulnerable sense of self.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We put these masks on when we&amp;rsquo;re scared, when we&amp;rsquo;re too afraid to ask for attention and love; when we&amp;rsquo;re on the verge of breaking, but don&amp;rsquo;t know how to ask for help. When we&amp;rsquo;re in search of something solid in the face of groundlessness. Even happiness is something we try too hard to hold onto, strangling it of all significance in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Feelings are signals: they point toward ourselves, toward the unknown. But they are not us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To take this non-attached perspective is more terrifying than the feelings themselves; we would rather feel angry and sad than risk being a lonely drop in the ocean. &amp;ldquo;Yet what is an ocean but a multitude of drops?&amp;rdquo; Non-attachment is not detachment. Detaching is active avoidance whereas non-attachment is active engagement––detachment runs while non-attachment sits and feels and notices with non-judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the vantage of non-attachment, we can see our feelings as they truly are: simply feelings, waves that come and go like the seasons; things as permanent as the illusory grounds they stand upon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then who are we if not our feelings? What is under the mask? What is left?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are something else entirely, something both more and less grounded, a shifting paradox, something wildly, unconditionally beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are the calm after a storm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A newborn&amp;rsquo;s first breath.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tiny motes of existence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A beam piercing through the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The light of Being.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Proof of grace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lucky.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Free.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After Belgium I spent a night in Prague and took a bus to Hungary the next morning. I stayed in Budapest for 10 days with Eszter, the Hungarian I had a crush on at the beginning of this whole adventure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It felt strange to be back in the swing of normalcy, as if such a thing was possible after walking the Camino.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I felt no bitterness or resentment toward Marieke. Actually, I was alarmed at how fast I seemed to be “moving on.” It was as if my mind had compartmentalized the Camino experience, like it was all some dream I had just woken from.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With Eszter it felt like nothing had changed, like I hadn&amp;rsquo;t walked the Camino. We talked with the same depth and intensity as we had in Canada, and I seemed to be living and acting like a normal human being. The feelings I had for her were still there too, which surprised me. Was I already losing the touch of Santiago?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact that it was over didn&amp;rsquo;t hit me until I was back home in California. October 26th, 2017. A teary-eyed Mother was waiting for me in LAX. She told me I looked like a tan monk. At home I hugged my Dad and my brother. I shared brief stories of my experience, then went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days I fell into a state of deep loneliness, despondence, and longing. My friends and parents tried to soothe my grievances, but they couldn&amp;rsquo;t. How could they? I was falling into a hole that simply didn&amp;rsquo;t exist in their world. &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re home now. Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t you be happy?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It became clear to me that I missed life on the road. But why? What was it that I missed? The simplicity? The friendships? The solitude? A sense of purpose? Purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was doing it all wrong. I was trying too hard to return to a place in my mind that was concrete and grounded, trying too hard to refit my life into the straitjacket I had fought so hard to escape from.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Purpose: I had searched the Camino for such a thing, but never found it. Only when I had abandoned my search and surrendered the idea that I could control every inch of my life did I feel content. The less I worried about what the future would bring or what my life meant, the happier I grew.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Purpose is useful. It keeps us afloat in our day to day, year to year existence, until the moment we take our final breath. Until then we have our greatest opportunity and responsibility: we get to choose what is and isn&amp;rsquo;t meaningful to us, what&amp;rsquo;s worth and not worth fighting for. Although the grand stage is, in some ways, already set, we get to decide how we want to play the game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suppose then I wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready to decide yet, what was and wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth dedicating my time and attention to, and I had to be okay with that. I had to be fine with sitting for awhile in the unknown, as terrifying as it was at times. What helped was realizing that it was worse to latch onto a purpose not designed and chosen by me. I needed to be patient with myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The world around me had not changed. It was I who was displaced, dislodged, different. I recognized it in the way I perceived things, in the way I talked with my friends, in the way I thought about time. I could feel it in the growing distance between who I thought I was and who I was becoming. Only once I had accepted that I had fundamentally changed, that I had grown, did I begin to find a sense of Home again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Home. Home isn&amp;rsquo;t really about a place or its inhabitants. Home begins and grows from the inner wellspring of one&amp;rsquo;s being. It&amp;rsquo;s as the cliche goes: home is where the heart is. Home is a landscape we carve from the varieties of experience that so happen to grace us. It is a conversation and collaboration between oneself and the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I did not know that I could only get the most out of life by giving myself up to it.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am thinking of this quote now as I ponder my arrival in Santiago. That feeling I had –– of wholeness, interconnectedness, fluidity, shapelessness, of being something outside of myself –– it didn&amp;rsquo;t last long, but something in me has shifted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The world seems more beautiful. Perspective is easier to hold and maintain. The everyday feels less mundane and more majestic. Little things don&amp;rsquo;t bother me as much. Peace and contentment are more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know I will still have my bad days and mood swings. I will still have my moments of doubt and paralysis when the darker depths of my mind take hold, moments when I am unable to see the light gleaming over the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I know it is always possible to get out, to surrender, to let go and be still, to feel what I feel without attachment, to be impermanent, to be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This moment. This precious, seamless moment. This is it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/home.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>17: Goodbye, again</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/17c-goodbye-again/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I arrive in Belgium late in the afternoon. The weather is exceptional: half-clouded skies with no reservation of sunlight, a perfect balance of cool and warm. I exit from the train station and hoist myself against a tall statue, eagerly looking for my squirrelly Belgium. 15 minutes pass before I spot her standing only 20 meters behind me, clad in a gray hoodie and a black leather jacket, lightly faded jeans and the tall leather boots of an amazon. Upon realizing that it was me looking at her, we sprint toward one another and embrace as if someone had just come home from war. It felt good to be in her arms again. Her radiating eyes still contained the ability to fully arrest my sensibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We catch up over coffee at a nearby restaurant. She reflects on the difficulties of returning home, the growing tension between her and her parents, and the continued struggle of trying to find balance within her medical studies. I tell her about the rest of my time on the Camino – the magical moments, the people I met, reaching Santiago, the decision not to go further, saying goodbye. It feels surreal, the fact that I was in Belgium, staying with someone I had met on the Camino only weeks prior, the fact that I was there with Marieke.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still confused about my feelings toward her. I believed I was in love, but something about it just didn’t feel right. Was it because we had met on the Camino? Would it have been too good to be true? Or did I simply get the impression that she wouldn’t love me back in the way I loved her? Was it really love? Or something else entirely?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was walking on a thin wire, unsure of when I would fall.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later we go to a park and continue our conversation. She mentions that Stepan had sent her a firey, passionate email admitting that he had fallen in love with her the moment they met. She seemed confused and a bit bewildered by the letter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We often wondered why he decided to walk the Camino, a question he always deflected or never gave a straight answer for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We brainstorm about what his motivations were for walking the Camino. Maybe he was a lost-soul searching for love; maybe he was just a normal guy struggling in life like everyone else, seeking solace in a foreign land. Maybe he did something unforgivable back in his home country. Whatever the case, the Camino had a way of connecting people despite the mysteries, sometimes because of them. On the Camino, the past wasn&amp;rsquo;t as important as the fact that we were simply there, walking together, sharing our common humanity, sharing a love of the road.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, our conversation transpires toward the topic of us – me and her – and she mentions something I will never forget: “You know, back on the Camino, I could have fallen in love with you. I wanted to. We grew so close so quickly, and it scared me a little. But I couldn&amp;rsquo;t. It would have changed the reasons for why we were there.” It was strange to talk so openly about us like this, but I reply that I understand and felt the same way. Though a different dialogue was playing in my head: Yes, love does change people, but that’s precisely what makes it so beautiful. Wasn’t the Camino about embracing all that comes your way?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We’re in her room, listening to Leonard Cohen. The question still lingers: do I love her? Does she love me? I won’t know until we talk about it. I won’t know until it&amp;rsquo;s out in the open.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m afraid. What if I jeopardize what we already have? No, we’re different. We can talk about anything and everything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My gut feels like a block of lead is hanging from it. My heart is beating faster and faster. It wants to hide. To run. To fly away. To breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to make of it, how to admit how I felt. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even sure of what I was feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A brittle piece of glass is standing on its corner at the edge of a table. Any amount of tumult or movement will tip it over. In the distance, a storm with the power to break trees, and men, is coming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A fire begins to kindle, and I turn toward Marieke. She looks straight at me. Through me. Inaudible words enter the air. Time collapses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I think I&amp;rsquo;m in love with you.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Emptiness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A messy knot of shoestrings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A moment between moments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Words.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Phil, I have never met anyone like you before.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What we have, I have never had it with anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You are so special to me&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wish I could fall in love with you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your love has no bounds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your love is so pure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You––”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something falls. A tiny piece of glass is shattering into a thousand tiny fractals. Time begins to sweep them into the pan of reality. A naked thread remains, the voice of Leonard Cohen echoes in the nearby distance:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your letters they all say that you&amp;rsquo;re beside me now.&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Then why do I feel alone?&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m standing on a ledge and your fine spider web&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;is fastening my ankle to a stone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now so long, Marianne, it&amp;rsquo;s time that we began&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;To laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next day, Marieke and I go to an African church service. I feel numb but put on a front. We sing with the choir and listen to a genial priest preach about love, forgiveness, redemption. I hear nothing. &lt;em&gt;What the hell do you know about love?&lt;/em&gt; We eat, drink, chat, and walk around. Things go on as planned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then we’re in the train station. A young, affectionate couple is sitting near us. They&amp;rsquo;re utterly in love, grossly enmeshed and atop one another. Time halts once again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anger. Sadness. Disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No. I can&amp;rsquo;t be angry, sad, disappointed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To be in love, to have fallen in love, to have been heartbroken. That, in a way, is a gift.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Am I rationalizing my pain? I don’t know. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We embrace one last time and say our goodbyes. I board the train and take one last look at her through the cloudy window. She looks back. I wave and turn inwards. A tear begins to creep down my cheek. I close my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I guess this is it then.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The engine whirs to life, and slowly, slowly, I am taken by the arms of an unknown future. The distance between dream and reality begins to grow, and I am pulled against my will toward the latter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Somewhere else in the world, the sun continues to shine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-final-letter-october-15th-2017&#34;&gt;My Final Letter: October 15th, 2017&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have to say that, as I sit here in the airport, I am feeling heartbroken. It&amp;rsquo;s not your fault; it&amp;rsquo;s no ones. It&amp;rsquo;s simply the nature of love. Initially, I felt numb because I was denying the fact that I was in love. It was one of the purest truths I have ever fought, because I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to get hurt; I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to jeopardize our friendship; I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to accept that maybe it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t right. And maybe all of my fears and insecurities are false, and the reason for why I feel what I do now is completely different. I may never know why, but it really doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter – it wasn&amp;rsquo;t meant to be. So I have to accept it – I will accept it. And in the process, I am letting the soft animal of my body feel what it feels, and love what it loves (Mary Oliver is on my mind as I write this to you).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And I will get back up stronger, more able to give love, more able to receive it, every day from this point on. I don&amp;rsquo;t think we ever know when we are ready for love, but that should not stop us from trying. Because that is what the truest form of love is. That is the only way we know it&amp;rsquo;s real. By trying. By loving. By getting hurt, and, if you’re one of the lucky ones, doing it all over again – maybe with a little less hurt each time. Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;M, know that you are so special, so able to receive, and give love. Don&amp;rsquo;t ever let anyone else tell you otherwise, including, especially, You.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I remember the day when you told me that you had never felt love before. That was on day 4 of our Camino. I then made a promise to myself to show you how it feels. I don’t know if I have been successful. But what I believe is, what we had, that was love. It’s possible. It’s real. Hang onto it. Carry it with you. Give it to someone else who will love you back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;rsquo;t blame yourself for the way I currently feel – I’ll be fine. I tell you this because you have been my best friend, you have taught me so much about life. Truly, I cannot fathom the depth of our relationship, and I cannot begin to express how thankful I am. I am tearing up as I write this, out of such joy and gratitude. This letter, I suppose, will mark the end of my Camino. It has taught me the final lesson I needed to learn: what it means to love.&#xA;-P&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/final.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>16: Santiago</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/16c-santiago/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.”&#xA;– Annie Dillard&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;october-8-2017---day-31&#34;&gt;October 8, 2017 - Day 31&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pedrouzo, Spain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 20 kilometers, I will reach Santiago de Compostela. The anticipation has left me sleepless. Ali and Karen are fast asleep. I hope to see them again soon. I pack my things and make a quiet exit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s dark out. Cars lie dormant under the hazy hue of flickering streetlights. Shop-signs strobe with a familiar fluorescence. I’m on the corner of a three-way intersection, eating a bun Karen had given me the night before. A wiry cat pokes its nose around, searching for food perhaps. Not too far ahead, I hear the rhythmic clacking of steel against pavement and rock. I finish my bun and proceed into the twilight, guided by nothing more than a small yellow arrow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neurons fire, muscles tense. One leg initiates, the other balances. Knee propels forward, heel touches ground. My weight shifts. Heel lifts, toes tip, a leg swings. One step, repeat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have suffered. I have endured pain. I am no longer under the illusion that life is best lived in pasts, shoulds, and futures. This is it. The people. The weather. The circumstances. Dusted boots and tall rucksacks. A sunflower. Cobalt skies. Birdsong. Valleys. One leg in front of the other. Trotting. Walking. Sauntering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A strange thing has happened. 10 kilometers from Santiago, while walking along a sidewalk, I was either hallucinating or vividly imagining the presence of every person I met on the Camino alongside me. Matilde and Franca were tiptoeing across the fence to my left, as if on a tightrope. Closer to me were Stepan, Jim, and Kathy. Marieke&amp;rsquo;s to my right. Everyone else was behind me, walking in silence. I realize that I have walked in solitude, but never have I been alone. The people, they have found a permanent place in my heart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Purpose may give direction to the journey, but it is our immediate presence and attention that gives it meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Santiago awaits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Santiago&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I reach Santiago de Compostela on October 8th of 2017. It&amp;rsquo;s a Sunday. I&amp;rsquo;m in a dreamy state of mind, not at all aware of time and unsure of what to expect upon reaching the cathedral. I sift through crowds of tourists and pilgrims, between narrow streets and alleyways, guided by nothing more than a yellow arrow. The sound of bagpipes and commotion fill the air. Something smells delicious. Anticipation is coursing through my veins.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/santiago2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I walk to the center of the plaza, dismount my rucksack, and sit for awhile. I look at the faces surrounding me, searching for a sign. I feel nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I turn my attention and notice a man looking at me. We stare at each other for what seems like an eternity. The look in his eyes speaks to me: Yes, you are here. Yes, you have made it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I begin to cry. Peace and stillness, awe and gratitude, love and surrender; I am filled with the energy of raw, unfiltered emotion. The boundary between the world and I dissipates. I feel connected, whole, complete. I am no longer just Phil. I am a fluid, living, impermeable being that simply lives behind a mask called Phil.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The people around me suddenly become more than just people. They&amp;rsquo;re human beings with families, friends, and feelings of their own; they are each in possession of their own unique stories, lives they’ve lived and will continue to live. They too will one day die. Their eyes emit a beautiful, radiating light, a light I can only describe as the light of Being, a light that says:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I am human. I too feel love, pain, suffering, joy, curiosity, wonder. I am you. You are me. A perfect bundle of imperfections. And here we are, together, on a journey across Spain, across life, living a shared existence on a tiny blue mote called Earth amid a less tiny, wildly unknown universe. This is it.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The man approaches me in tears, and we hold each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/santiago3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;october-9-2017---the-day-after&#34;&gt;October 9, 2017 - The Day After&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Santiago de Compostela is the official endpoint of the Camino, though some pilgrims decide to walk the extra 90 or so kilometers to Finisterre, a coastal city at the edge of Spain, the end of the world. I had intended to end my journey there, but something convinced me otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I walk for 20 kilometers before feeling that something is off. It just doesn’t feel the same. My sense of purpose is gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why had I decided to continue in the first place? I have always known how to persevere, how to press on, how to move forward – it had carried me through the pain, to Santiago. But something is telling me the journey needs to end back in the city. At the next town I hop on a bus back to Santiago. In the past I would have felt a pang of regret, a bruising of my ego, for not muscling through to the end. But there was no feeling of regret or any longing for more. I felt content. I had had enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was one of the best decisions I had ever made. Over the next 4 days, I say goodbye to all of the significant people I had met:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/santiago4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ali and Karen (the brother and sister I met on my second to last day). They “adopted” me, and I really bonded with Ali. He felt like a long-lost older brother.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/santiago5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jim and Kathy (nearly cried after seeing them. It had been at least 1.5 weeks since we had last seen each other. They were my first friends. Kathy said, “The journey is coming full-circle.&amp;quot; Indeed, it was.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/santiago6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And of course, me and my favorite Germans: Franca and Matilde. I ran into them right after running into Jim and Kathy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/santiago7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Karaoke!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/santiago8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The journey would not have been the same without them and the many others with whom I do not have pictures with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there was still one story left to close: Marieke.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I still had to go see about a girl.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>15: Letters Worth Czeching Out</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/15c-letters-czech/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/15c-letters-czech/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote these letters to my friend, Stepan, from the Czech Republic. Including them because they might help to create a better picture of my experience. He had joined M and I a few days before M left. These letters were written afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;september-23-2017&#34;&gt;September 23, 2017&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hey it&amp;rsquo;s Phil.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I walked to Hontanas yesterday from Burgos (about 30 km). It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful village worth staying at. Today I&amp;rsquo;m walking to Itero de Vega, about 21 km. Glad you&amp;rsquo;re on the go again, see you soon I&amp;rsquo;m sure, ultreya y suseya!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;–Phil&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hey, thats where Im heading today :) yeah, Im on the way but still not feeling well, hope it wont get worse, cheewing garlic all day, poor pilgrims I meet :) see ya.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;–Stepan&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I walked 32 km today to Fromista&amp;hellip; not sure why but really didn&amp;rsquo;t like the town before it so I walked further. Also, I got your text but not M&amp;rsquo;s, so I will email her. If you could let her know that I can&amp;rsquo;t receive her texts, that&amp;rsquo;d be cool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday it hit me like a wrecking ball that she wasn&amp;rsquo;t here anymore&amp;hellip; sorta felt shitty and then – no joke – climbed to the top of a hill in my melancholy state, almost cried, then just started talking to the sky and myself, letting out my grievances&amp;hellip; and then the weight was lifted. As if I had finally accepted it. That’s the simple version :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I watched the sunset alone. Wasn&amp;rsquo;t the same of course, but the beautiful thing about sunsets is that they are always beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I feel ready to keep moving. Met a Korean Priest walking from Burgos who pointed me in the right direction. Told me that life doesn’t always give an immediate answer to things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Feeling good. Feet sore but not too bad. Gonna slow down tomorrow. See you soon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ultreya y suseya,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;–Phil&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I got to Hontanas and a fever knocked me out. Took a private room and thinking of staying for couple of days and see if I&amp;rsquo;ll recover. Just watched the sunset here. You’re right, it’s always beautiful. even when watching it alone has no sense as when shared. Prayed in a little chapel of st. Bridget at the beginning of the village for pilgrims and for M. She’s the only thing I can think about. Without her it is so empty. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a long way ahead to myself and learning a lot of things. You’re not alone in doubts, questions and all the things, dont worry bro. I got all crazy about doing The Key, to Muxia and Fisterra, I planted it in my brain so deep, felt like without it the whole camino would go in vain. Now I maybe hallucinating because of fever, but somehow I feel for a moment I stopped seeing the way and saw only the destination, I was so wrong, it’s like camino through my body is telling me to slow down and enjoy the way, for the way itself is the destination. Got to go far behind the village to get some data signal, for their wifi is not working, nor data, strange. If I was silent for couple of days it means I have no internet connection and strength to seek some :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to walk alone, for you’re never alone on camino. Even if you make no other friends, there are the ones you’ve already made. And don’t fear to ask yourself questions for it means that there are things yet to be asked and solved and this is what we have to do in our lives. Searching for answers is sometimes better and more giving than finding answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultreya y suseya.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stepan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;september-25-2017&#34;&gt;September 25, 2017&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hey Stepan,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m keeping you in my thoughts daily and am wishing you a speedy recovery. This too is a part of the journey.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every new day continues to bring something wonderful and new. Two days ago, I had dinner with some older Americans. They enjoyed hearing my youthful stories. One of them even took my picture and had sent it to my mother&amp;hellip; it was pretty hilarious. And unexpectedly, they paid for my dinner! I was so grateful for their company and kindness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I stayed at Albergue Santa Maria in a nice little town called Carrion de los Condes (would recommend staying there). I saw Gale there too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At night, there were nuns who started singing and playing music in my albergue. They sang a Spanish version of Hallelujah, it was incredible. Then they sang a song in Japanese! I think it surprised everyone – it definitely surprised me. It’s a beautiful language. This was truly one of the best nights. I am excited because we still have so many days ahead. It&amp;rsquo;s up to us to find the magic in each moment and in every step along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I walk, my sense of love for the world grows deeper. I hope you&amp;rsquo;re continuing to grow each day on the Camino. This place&amp;hellip; this road&amp;hellip; the Way… it’s magic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to hearing from ya.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh, one final thing:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wrote this thing about shadows today. Thought you might like it (this happened to be the first draft of 9: An Ode to the Road):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each and every day, I wake and walk with the sun behind me.&#xA;It starts low, climbing over hillsides, rising slowly.&#xA;It finds its temporary place along the sky, and begins to color the Meseta.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Front and center a shadow grows.&#xA;It looks at me with indifference, a mirror of my darker side –&#xA;fear, insecurity, doubt;&#xA;The manifestation of my inner demons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each and every day, I wake and walk to confront these demons.&#xA;However, if I fight and struggle, I hurt and suffer.&#xA;If I push it away, I push myself away.&#xA;I cannot hide, I cannot run,&#xA;I can only bear witness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My only salvation is to turn away from the sun. Dare I do it?&#xA;The shadow turns abyss, an immediate apocalypse.&#xA;No. To turn from the sun is to turn from the truth;&#xA;I would be swallowed whole.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My shadow is here,&#xA;my shadow is me.&#xA;As long as I walk the Way,&#xA;it will keep me company.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I must not be afraid&#xA;I must not close my eyes&#xA;I must continue on every day,&#xA;chasing the rising to dawn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each and every day, I wake and walk towards Santiago.&#xA;The closer I get, the lighter I feel.&#xA;In front of me the sun hangs low, peering over hillsides, descending slowly.&#xA;The color fades from the Meseta, and my shadow is behind me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Westward lies Santiago. I look.&#xA;The sun has set, the dark has settled.&#xA;A fire is growing deep inside.&#xA;It lights the valley and shows the Way.&#xA;I wake and walk towards the Light,&#xA;Closer and closer to Santiago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultreia y suseia (always higher, always further, the nuns mentioned this phrase)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;–Phil&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hey P. So excited to read your experiences and walk to yourself. I am so happy for you bro, you deserve all the truth and acceptance coming to you. But your final observation, that&amp;rsquo;s a hard one really, sooo striking, true and beautiful. It&amp;rsquo;s like you&amp;rsquo;re stealing these words from the deepest of my soul. That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what I was telling M. in different words&amp;hellip; it is amazing how you let Camino talk to you and teach you, that&amp;rsquo;s because you&amp;rsquo;re sensitive and special. There&amp;rsquo;s not enough people like this on this world&amp;hellip; never stop being yourself, never start pretending to fulfill others&amp;rsquo; expectations. Keep on walking the Camino till your very death, always on a search for better and deeper and insightful you&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Right now I see no shadow as I am not walking, it&amp;rsquo;s like my shadow has conquered my mind and my soul, got me trapped in the middle of my fear and when I can&amp;rsquo;t see it it&amp;rsquo;s more difficult to face it and fight it, even impossible to accept it. I feel like home, so eager to make changes yet so far away of actually doing it.. I&amp;rsquo;ll take one more day of this helplessness and then I will need to decide what next. I wish to continue, but it suddenly feels so distant and my soul feels empty.. at least I have my heart filled again and that&amp;rsquo;s a true Camino miracle to me&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Walk it step by step Philip and watch out for signs, even the small ones&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;–Stepan&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;september-29-2017&#34;&gt;September 29, 2017&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hey Stepan,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hope you&amp;rsquo;re feeling more of yourself and on the move again. How have the past days been? What did you decide to do? How&amp;rsquo;s the fever? What have you learned?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in Astorga right now. I&amp;rsquo;ve been walking a lot more lately - 37km, 24km and another 32km today. Feel like I should slow down, I feel too focused on reaching places instead of being a part of the journey. Life here is feeling more &amp;rsquo;normal&amp;rsquo;, so it&amp;rsquo;s harder to find the magic, but not impossible. I still look forward to each new day and to what it will bring. All of my recent joys have been through little moments – shooting stars, seeing people I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen in awhile, meeting new people who present new perspectives. The idea of teaching in Spain has been playing in my mind, especially after Leon and Astorga. We&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Santiago is getting closer. Which means less time on Camino. I do feel a bit afraid of &amp;lsquo;returning&amp;rsquo; to normal life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, hope to hear from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Warm blessings,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Phil&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hey mate. Went to see a doctor in Castrojeriz, got ATB for really nasty bronchitis and stayed few more days, coughing my lungs out :) it was today&amp;rsquo;s morning when I braced up, said fuck the illness, this is my Camino, ATB will do their job and I shall do mine and that is walking. Made it to Poblacion de Campos and I&amp;rsquo;m on the go again. I recalled Gale saying if I break my leg I&amp;rsquo;ll continue on my knee if I break my knee I&amp;rsquo;ll crawl.. laughed and said to myself that I don&amp;rsquo;t need to finish it, I just want to.. it was tough since I decided at 9:30 :) and then got all the sun along the way and indescribable amount of dust, but got a shower now and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel that bad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve met really great and caring hospitaleros in Castrojeviz, they were making me ginger tea for free and we were talking about running an albergue as a business, several wise insights.. also the doctor was great, no English but so caring and willing to help that we finally found understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re far ahead and almost running, I see.. you still got plenty of time uh? Maybe slowing down is a good idea, unluckily for me I cannot afford it if I want to make it to Santiago as 15th Oct. is my flight back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Castrojeriz I stumbled upon an interesting place, a hospital for soul, it was a house of some yogi man who lives there, but anyone can come in and rest, each room being a true sanctuary with paintings and quotes and places to sit, spiritual music playing silently, half color light half shadows. Behind the house was a true zen garden with sparkling water basin.. really a piece of peace.. I especially liked one quote saying &amp;ldquo;walking on the water is not a miracle, the miracle is walking on the earth&amp;rdquo; and it felt so fitting on the Camino.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do not expect a miracle or magic on every kilometer on the Camino. All the miracles are already within ourselves, the Camino is just a revelation, opening our inner eyes. It is a way of ordinary people, for everyone can walk it and experience something different, so it is perfectly ok if it sometimes feels normal. And you&amp;rsquo;re right Camino will always be your part and you can benefit from it forever. Teaching in Spain?:) what happened to the Czech republic :))&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Always higher, always further,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stepan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;september-30-2017&#34;&gt;September 30, 2017&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Man, so happy to get your email. Glad you&amp;rsquo;re still on the Camino and kicking ass one step at a time. I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ll be back to full strength sooner rather than later. It&amp;rsquo;s actually Gael by the way. Like Guy-El. Had a funny dinner with him in Leon. He taught me a lot and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take no for an answer when he offered me half his food. &amp;ldquo;You help make my pack lighter&amp;rdquo;. Really kind and genuine guy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think I will keep my pace as that will allow me to reach FinisTerra. Meeting a lot of people who plan to go there and say it has its own magic. Met an amazing American woman who works as a therapist. She told me the whole story of why the Camino exists.. with St James and all that. Inspiring. She reminded me of an experience I had: &amp;ldquo;The Camino will give you everything you need, but not always everything you want.&amp;rdquo; At that point in time, I was feeling phased out – my head wasn’t in the game. Perhaps the Meseta had taken a toll on my body and mind. But today, walking through Galicia, I felt much more at home. The trees are a deep green and the mountains are refreshing. I then remembered one of my favorite poems and recited it in my head. And I don&amp;rsquo;t know why or how, but once again, a weight was lifted. I felt reborn. The past few days my body has become much stronger. I now feel little to no pain. I am so grateful for this new sense of physical strength.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Continuing to meet all the necessary people along the way. And also receiving the necessary solitude too. I find so much joy and contentment in my solo walks now. It feels as if I were walking for the first time on the Camino again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Glad to hear from you. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably be in Santiago on 9 or 10 of October. Got a good feeling about it, but not setting expectations. Still trying to enjoy each and every day. Can&amp;rsquo;t believe I’ve been here for 3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See ya soon I&amp;rsquo;m sure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;–P&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;october-5-2017&#34;&gt;October 5, 2017&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Been receiving your texts but unable to reply for whatever reason.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Glad you&amp;rsquo;re ok after going off-roading ;) whether it&amp;rsquo;s a miracle or coincidence or luck is a matter of how you want to see it. For me it&amp;rsquo;s a miracle. But don&amp;rsquo;t expect it to happen often. Just being real.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are you walking barefoot now? I&amp;rsquo;m not even crazy even to try it (on my first Camino&amp;hellip; next time for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in Gonzar&amp;hellip; less than 90km from Santiago. It feels surreal. Walked 31 today because I just love the Camino and this region. Letting whatever comes come, feelings and everything else. Slowing way down though. Walking 9 KM tomorrow to a well-reputed donativo tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;–P&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hi there, I&amp;rsquo;m in Astorga. Have made over 190 over the last 6 days and it is a deadly pace, keeping me busy all day long, not exactly what I wanted.. I wish I had more time, I&amp;rsquo;d slow down to 20 a day to have time to visit churches, sit in the cafes and smell the roses :) did you meet David before Astorga? The hermit living in the ruins offering pilgrims free fruit and all the drinks? I wish I could have spent there all the afternoon.. met some hippie pilgrims there and two of them czech:) it was fun to speak czech for the first in a month&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Doing like 33 really takes me all day so I&amp;rsquo;m always the last pilgrim of the day.. three days ago (that day with the raven and police) I did regular 34 of Camino plus those 7 off the track meaning 41 and arriving to Bercianos del real camino at 19h. Wanted to stay at a parroquial albergue but it was full, hospitallero laughed at me, gave me water and some fruits and told me I had 3 options.. another private albergue or a bar with accommodation or another town 7.5km further.. I felt like fainting.. went to the other albergue.. full too.. so went to the bar, it had only private rooms and only one left.. man I have never taken out those 30euros from my pocket that quick :)) had a shower and dinner and then at 21h went back to the parroquial albergue for there was supposed to be some evening ceremony.. entering the building, I saw hospitallero taking in two Russians&amp;hellip; I was literally like WTF?! Anyways went to the ceremony and it felt so rubbish, all the faces somehow empty.. man I was so pissed and felt so lonely that night.. but I guess that&amp;rsquo;s a part of the Camino too..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No I am not walking barefoot that was just a joke for the next pilgrims. I bought new pair of shoes for the adidas were really killing me causing blisters underneath blisters.. but now I am doing first 15 in the new shoes and other 15 in sandals with my socks on and it is actually great.. freedom to the feet :) enjoy the rest of the journey, I&amp;rsquo;ll be in Santiago on 14th..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I totally get the surreal feeling..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stepan&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;october-7-2017&#34;&gt;October 7, 2017&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hi mate how’s your Camino? Gonna be in Santiago tomorrow or so? Wish you all the best.. hope it will be the best moment of your life.. and that’s just the beginning of an endless row of best days…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stepan&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hey, looks like you&amp;rsquo;re having fun in the photo! I&amp;rsquo;m glad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I will be in Santiago around noon or so. I&amp;hellip; I feel a plethora of emotions&amp;hellip; sadness that it will soon be over, joy and gratitude for having been on this journey, love that I&amp;rsquo;ve met so many amazing people. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I can sleep tonight. It&amp;rsquo;s as if a knot has tied itself a million times over in my stomach. That&amp;rsquo;s partly why I haven&amp;rsquo;t written much. Already started tearing up walking through Arzua thinking about it today, about the memories, the people, the personal breakthroughs. Not sure what to expect. I have no expectations. Whatever happens I hope to have the strength to let it be free and expressed. Met a wonderful pair of brother and sister today. They gave me strength, especially the brother. Amazing because even though he&amp;rsquo;s 49, I&amp;rsquo;ve never felt so at ease with an older guy. He’s young in spirit. Made a deep connection walking with him after his sister had to take a taxi due to knee issues. Talked about love, the magic of the Camino, life lessons. He shared a secret with me&amp;hellip; one that he only has ever told to his sister. Really made me feel special&amp;hellip; said he felt a kinship with me. Honestly, it felt like I was walking with an older version of myself, a much wiser man yet we shared so much in common – quiet, reserved, calm. Can&amp;rsquo;t even describe it, he was really who I needed at that moment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyways I&amp;rsquo;m doing&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m doing. Ready to walk, ready and not ready for Santiago. I will do it alone, but knowing that I&amp;rsquo;m never truly alone. It is the gift the Camino has given me – a love that allows me to walk with joy, even in solitude. Thanks for checking in. The timing is perfect. I hope you&amp;rsquo;re well. I would be lying if I didn&amp;rsquo;t want you guys with me at Santiago. But this is the gift, this is what Camino is asking me to do, and I accept the invitation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something tells me I will be better for it. Also, I have a feeling that I will see everyone again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;–Phil&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am happy for you bro and I shall walk with you tomorrow to Santiago in my thoughts. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more happier if we arrived there the three of us. But that would be what I&amp;rsquo;d want too&amp;hellip; and Camino gives you only what your soul need, not what you want, remember?;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is a gift, yet deserved. You have walked your camino humbly with your heart open and with joy, a true pilgrim, not some kind of a tourist that it seems I get to meet these days..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;so do it again, walk with your heart open and embrace whatever comes your way.. I am sure it will be good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have one last week of walking and cannot deny that I&amp;rsquo;m too starting to think about the approaching end and feeling fears of getting back to the grey of old life&amp;hellip; what if no change comes.. no, that&amp;rsquo;s not gonna happen. I will make changes and I won&amp;rsquo;t think about it till the end of my camino and will walk it more humbly too. I am so glad that I can still be here.. that I stopped only to start over and not to quit..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, camino&amp;rsquo;s still calling&amp;hellip; and we shall answer this call.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wish you the greatest walk ever though I am not gonna see your eyes when you get there.. but I&amp;rsquo;ll see them another time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;–Stepan&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>14: Letters to a Camino Soulmate</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/14c-letters-soulmate/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/14c-letters-soulmate/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;These are the emails Marieke and I wrote to each other after she was gone. They might give you a better picture of my Camino experience. Writing to her was always a highlight. Sorry for the grammar. I wrote every letter on my phone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;september-21-2017&#34;&gt;September 21, 2017&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I just realized I did not give you my email. Safe travels! Thank you for everything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;–Phil&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;september-23-2017&#34;&gt;September 23, 2017&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, as I walked away from Burgos, it hit me: you are gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I had reached my destination, I went to the church and sat in silence for awhile – I even prayed! My mind ran through all of our moments and memories, like a broken record player… I was drowning under the weight of an emotional tsunami.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I climbed a hill until the people were nothing more than ants. I stayed for awhile, gazing at the sky and clouds, trying to make sense of my emotions, trying to fill the maw your absence had left. Thoughts came and went, feelings mixed and churned. Time moved at the pace of a snail.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then an odd thing happened: I began talking to myself. It was like the unconscious part of me had finally connected the dots; I started to laugh at myself and began shouting at the sky until I reached this profound state of peace, of liberation. There was nothing left but clarity and stillness. I felt free, weightless.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wrote that bus note believing I had already accepted the fact that you were leaving. Yet, it was only when I admitted to myself that I missed you did I find some semblance of tranquility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I watched the sunset. It hid behind a thicket of clouds and colored the sky a deep and dark red. I smiled because it felt like the universe had given me peace. It knew I was ready to let go. The crimson sky faded into night. Symbolic right? Red is your favorite color.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, there are no sad or lonely feelings. And it&amp;rsquo;s not because I don&amp;rsquo;t miss you anymore, rather, I am filled with gratitude each time my mind replays a memory. I look forward to the day that we cross paths again. I know it&amp;rsquo;s not the last time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;-Phil&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;september-25-2017&#34;&gt;September 25, 2017&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dearest, dearest Phil!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am so sorry for giving you a sign of life only now&amp;hellip; When I took place on the bus, I felt a hole in my heart that was so big that I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t bear it. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t write. It was just too painful. I missed you in everything, I could hear you laughter and your jokes in everything, even though you were not here I would hear your interesting questions and opinions continuously in my mind. I can still see you ahead of me, with the orange water bottle swinging in your hand&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here in Belgium life continues, the beginning of the semester is extremely busy. Most people take little interest in the fact that I lived for three weeks on the Camino and barely know what it means. My friends do their utmost best to listen, but they were not there with you; they cannot understand. I feel like I would need more time to contemplate and maybe have some mourning process too, but life allows me only some stolen moments. When I walk through my garden and I look up, I can see the same stars as you, I see sunlight playing a color game with the leaves of the trees just as they existed in Spain, I hear the same birds as you. They are like calls from a faraway universe. I hear you in them&amp;hellip; The pain of missing you is getting better day by day. It is the grace of life: everything changes, everything flows, the good and the bad. What doesn&amp;rsquo;t wear off, is that I feel incredibly close to you. The initial hole in my heart is now filled with your warm presence, you are with me all day and I know that you are one of these people I will be carrying forever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know that your experience on that mountain was probably very similar to mine. There are no words to explain the perfect beauty and mercy of such a moment&amp;hellip; We cannot create them alone, they are partly also given to us by something greater than us. You cannot explain, but simply know that something in you has thoroughly changed. I came very close to crying again, when I read about your experience, I was immensely grateful that your listening to Camino had led you also to such an experience. Your writing about it was so beautiful that I actually printed it and hung it on my wall&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I start to see more and more why I had to return to Belgium. I think it had something to do partly with finding a real and human balance in my life, but there is more. It is not very correct to say that I just left Belgium for Camino. Rather, I fled from it. I had been facing repeating patterns in relationships for years, and had just entered a next one that was actually very harmful to me but I lacked the strength to end it. This Camino, and especially you and my mountain experience, have given me true love to myself. I cannot longer do things that are harmful to me&amp;hellip; I feel so, so strong now&amp;hellip; I now want to learn to feel love, I want to learn to love others. I feel that many things in me have ripened during Camino, up to a level where they can start to give fruits. I notice that there is more life in the bonds I have with other people. It gives me hope, for I have feared for so long that I was a mistake of nature – born without feelings. The only relation that is still really fucked up, is the one with my parents. Emotionally, I feel a thousand miles away from them, and it only gets worse. They have no time for me, I am too proud by now to run after them, the result is that we barely know each other anymore. It hurts me a lot. It feels like they care very little for me&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know this is probably a strange mail to you, more some concatenation of random topics.. Writing is not my strength, and I lack the patience to reread what I wrote. Sorry! :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please, tell me more about how things are going on Camino.. if you talk about it, it feels to me almost as if I were also there.. What is Camino sending you at the moment? Who are the people you meet? Are you walking the Meseta, do you like it? And.. what was your miracle today?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I send you an incredibly warm hug, and all the love that I can!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;-Marieke&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;september-26-2017&#34;&gt;September 26, 2017&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My heart totally skipped a beat when I saw your message in my inbox. I&amp;rsquo;m really happy to hear from you. I enjoyed your concatenation of thoughts! It was sporadic and spontaneous. Keep writing from your heart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The day I left Burgos, I met a Korean Catholic Priest near the edge of the city. There was a warm presence about him, something friendly and inviting, like a hot cup of tea. He strolled up to me and we started talking about religion, our families, and why we were walking the Camino. Then he asked a very interesting question: what are the most important things in your life? And for some reason, I had no immediate answer. I felt a bit guilty. He responded, &amp;ldquo;Ah, see you&amp;rsquo;re not like most people. They usually say something right away: friends, family, work. But you didn&amp;rsquo;t. Why?&amp;rdquo; I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure why. He then said that it was ok not to know, and better to continue asking Why. Why is family important? Why this.. and that&amp;hellip; we left the question unanswered. Again, he asked why I was here. I told him I was looking for direction&amp;hellip; for purpose. He replied Why?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He finally gave an answer after I gave some more inconclusive replies: &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s simple, ask why and follow the answer your heart gives. You have a good heart. Listen to it. It knows. It&amp;rsquo;s ok to keep asking too and not get an answer. Ask why.&amp;rdquo; He then asked to take a selfie with me, and he walked away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, I find myself asking Why as I consider all of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve ever wanted to be: artist, journalist, radio host, writer, English teacher, university professor, counselor, therapist, physical therapist, psychiatrist, lifestyle designer, coach, school psychologist&amp;hellip; these sorts of roles are deeply human-centric&amp;hellip; I seem to require intimate human connection in my work. I can see myself as a healer of sorts, as someone who walks / guides people through life. I&amp;rsquo;m still asking Why.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This past Sunday, I stopped in Carrion de los Condes at Albergue Santa Maria. It was like our first night in the donativo. The other pilgrims and I sat in a large rectangular formation and shared our names and motivations for walking the Camino. The stories were moving. A Korean woman diagnosed with Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease had decided to walk the Camino to fight against it, to prove to everyone around her that she would not let the disease consume her life. Her hand was trembling as she used her phone to translate her message into English and Spanish. I was on the verge of tears.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Others walked for self-redemption, for answers to life&amp;rsquo;s biggest questions, for love. I shared with them that I came in search of direction, but that I have received so much more – myself, my voice, my heart, joy, sadness, gratitude&amp;hellip; and of course, I mentioned how I met you, Matilde, and Franca, all over a cup of tea&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t know if there&amp;rsquo;s a better story than ours. Anyways, amid the words being lost in translation, the universal language of music beckoned. The nuns started playing songs on the guitar, and we sang! Like a choir, we sang a Spanish rendition of Hallelujah&amp;hellip; and then the nuns sang a Japanese song for one of the Japanese pilgrims&amp;hellip; what a beautiful language! These nuns were not your ordinary nuns. I slept with a smile that night.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been walking with an older woman from Columbia. Her English isn&amp;rsquo;t the best, but she understands what I&amp;rsquo;m saying, for the most part&amp;hellip; maybe she&amp;rsquo;s being nice and only laughs at my own jokes because I laugh at them. I almost told her your squirrel joke, but I forgot some of it. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh! Yesterday, I met a really cool French girl. We made some small talk and I walked her to the end of the village. I had a feeling I would see her again. And sure enough, today, while I was unpacking, I saw her enter my albergue – she ended up in the same room as me! We were talking about books, and I asked if she had any in English. She said one&amp;hellip; guess which? THE POWER OF NOW. The only book you were carrying, she happened to be carrying too. Crazy, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, tomorrow morning&amp;hellip; at 4 AM&amp;hellip;. I&amp;rsquo;m walking with her and her friend, Morgan, to catch some shooting stars. Not sure what I&amp;rsquo;m getting myself into, but this is the opportunity that has presented itself, so I will take it and adventure on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The meseta stretches far, but it is beautiful. One day, I walked 17km straight. There were no places to stop for a break. It was brutal, but the sunrise was nice, as was the landscape. Many would say the meseta is a bland belt of dust and wheat, but there is so much life in the trees, air, and grass. It&amp;rsquo;s also much easier to notice a change of color when the fields are all a singular shade of gold! No blackberries though, sadly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Missing that squirrelly girl obsessed with blackberries. I think she gave me some of her magic though. I had the “Best Coffee Ever” yesterday, so smooth and creamy, I could taste the love.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have so much more to say, but it&amp;rsquo;s getting late and I&amp;rsquo;ll be up at 4:00am. I wish I could just teleport to you, with a cup of your favorite coffee in my hand and share everything in my head. There&amp;rsquo;s so so much.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You’re not a mistake of nature. And you’re more than capable of loving. I&amp;rsquo;ve felt it. We&amp;rsquo;re all screwed up in our own way&amp;hellip; maybe we just need to find the people who love us anyways. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to say about you and your parents&amp;hellip; That isn&amp;rsquo;t an easy thing to live with. You feel it so much more than any words can describe, or that anyone can truly relate to to be helpful. All I can offer is a listening ear and an open heart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s so much more to say, but not enough time. I know you know of the Camino struggles. Anyways, from the wholeness of my heart, sleep well, dream on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;–Phil&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;september-27-2017&#34;&gt;September 27, 2017&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today I walked 38km&amp;hellip; I am in Leon with the sorest of feet, but the biggest of smiles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I imagine you buried beneath a mound of books, bones, and cadavers. Make sure to see the light of day. Don’t forget to do you, to maintain balance, to make your art! Busyness is the enemy of time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s strange, there are moments when I feel that you are still walking and talking to me. You tell me to slow down, to enjoy the little things (because they&amp;rsquo;re actually the big things), to relish the company of nature. I miss enjoying these things with you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think I will sleep well tonight. This was one of my toughest yet most rewarding days, full of many wonderful blessings, people, and lessons. I&amp;rsquo;m dozing off now, twilight calls, that eternal place of peaceful nothingness. Each day still feels so fresh and new. I am always pleasantly surprised.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;-Phil&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;october-1-2017&#34;&gt;October 1, 2017&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Galicia is beautiful. I feel so at home and energized being surrounded by the green vegetation and high mountains. Wish you could feel the cool, mountainous air.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A miracle: after 2 days of hip, ankle, and achilles pain, the Camino seems to have given me new legs. As I was walking, the pain suddenly disappeared. I was freaking out and telling everyone around me what had happened. They said I should be grateful, and I was.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Random note: I&amp;rsquo;ve memorized Wild Geese. It was on a day when I was feeling a bit blue, melancholy and lonely. It&amp;rsquo;s strange, even though I feel this deep love for myself and life, loneliness and sadness seem to always be accompanying me, like shadows. I suppose that means I&amp;rsquo;m human. But I know the feelings will pass, like the rush of a cool summer breeze. Anyways, during one of my breaks, I sat and read Wild Geese at least 5 times, until I memorized it. Now each and every time I recite it, I feel so much joy… this line always brings me to tears: &amp;ldquo;whoever you are, no matter how lonely / the world offers itself to your imagination, / calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting - over and over announcing your place in the family of things.&amp;rdquo; It makes me feel at peace,connected with the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I sent some pictures to my parents. Their immediate response was: why aren&amp;rsquo;t you in the pictures? To which I replied Because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be, it&amp;rsquo;s a personal reason related to why I am on the Camino. They then said How do we know these are yours then&amp;hellip; reading that made me furious. Did they not trust me? Did they still see me as a helpless child, unable to make his own decisions, unable to have his own feelings and beliefs? I felt disconnected and misunderstood. Conceptually, I understood their response – they’re parents. But emotionally, I lost control.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At that moment, I didn&amp;rsquo;t love them. And then I hated myself for feeling that. I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have. Sometimes, we just lose control and say and think things we don’t mean. Still, I turned my phone off and walked around Astorga to clear my head. Then I ran into two of my friends. They helped me to process and make peace with the situation. Sadly, one of them is leaving soon. I felt a true kinship with him because he was so interested in life. He showed me the value of simply listening and watching. A true photographer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Final bit of update: so… I refunded my flight to Amsterdam from Paris. Guess where I’m heading instead? I just ask that you be home October 14th&amp;hellip; I really wanted to surprise you, but I know you said to tell you in advance if I were to visit&amp;hellip; that&amp;rsquo;s not to say that I&amp;rsquo;m visiting, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll be in the area on that day&amp;hellip; possibly&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ok. Assuming you&amp;rsquo;re still buried under a bag of bodies and books, I&amp;rsquo;ll bring a shovel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve become addicted to Spanish milk. It is my lifeblood. I think it contributed to my newfound legs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As Santiago nears, I feel a plethora of emotions, and some sense of expectation. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s hard not to have expectations since everyone is talking about how beautiful and amazing it is. Still, I’m trying to take it day by day. Each day is so special and full of life. I will let Santiago come when it comes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;–Phil&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;october-2-2017&#34;&gt;October 2, 2017&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying for a few days now to find some time to write back decently (and no, not because I&amp;rsquo;m buried in books :p), but this cannot wait: I&amp;rsquo;M SO VERY EXCITED THAT YOU COME! :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just tell me, which days exactly will you be in Belgium? I&amp;rsquo;ll provide your fifteen star hotel, of course! :D&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;–Marieke&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;october-3-2017&#34;&gt;October 3, 2017&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No rush to reply! And 15 out of 100? I expected more from Belgium ;) I will be there Oct. 14-15, and leave to Prague the night of the 15th.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;-Phil&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;october-6-2017&#34;&gt;October 6, 2017&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, it seems that I am closing the distance between me and Santiago. With less than 55 km to go, I will be there on Sunday, probably around noon. I&amp;rsquo;m trying my damndest not to count the kilometers, to focus on the present moment, but it&amp;rsquo;s difficult! I need to keep my head in the game and to remember to actually taste my coffee&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The past week or so (really, since Burgos), I&amp;rsquo;ve walked alone, which leaves room for the free flow of my thoughts. They come and go in all shapes and forms, some really random, others more anxious and fearful. But they are just that, thoughts. They are not me. I know this because my mood instantly shifts the moment I notice the sound of my footsteps against the stones, the chirping of the birds, the rustling of leaves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been having these second winds on my walk, sudden bursts of energy that drive me forward with the force of a raging river. I feel free and limitless in this state&amp;hellip; I stop noticing thoughts, I feel outside of my body, I am attuned to my surroundings… I am high on life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Been wondering if what the Camino has given me is the gift of solitude. Because only in solitude do you hear the sound of your own voice. Then it&amp;rsquo;s a matter of knowing which sound is your mind, and which is your heart. As of late, it&amp;rsquo;s becoming easier to hear the latter, &amp;ldquo;This is your heart / can you feel it, / can you feel it?&amp;rdquo; (Bastille - Laura Palmer). To clearly hear my own voice, that was one of my intentions for coming to the Camino. I miss you, Franca, Matilde, and S; I miss having wonderful people like you guys to share these experiences with. Yet there is another kind of solitary joy that I&amp;rsquo;ve been experiencing every day. I find it sometimes in the darkest of corners, right when I need it most, and I end up smiling and laughing wildly at myself, at something I wrote in my journal, at something I drew or something that happened during the day. (I passed two people and yelled, &amp;ldquo;Woo! Another day on the Way!&amp;rdquo; They loved it.). In reflection of moments like these, I know the Camino is asking me to reach Santiago alone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I feel so strong. I have an insatiable desire to learn, to taste, to live, to start the next part of my life journey.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I think this will be my last update until I see you. I&amp;rsquo;m wicked excited to see that smile and to hear more squirrel jokes. By the way, I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to Leonard Cohen, and I think Suzanne is my current favorite. Check out the acoustic version of &amp;ldquo;The Woods&amp;rdquo; by Hollow Coves. Best listened to under a tree, illuminated by starlight. See you soon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;–Phil&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;october-7-2017&#34;&gt;October 7, 2017&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not so good at writing and I don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy it as much as you do, which is probably one of the reasons why I postpone writing back everyday. But every e-mail of you manages to bring me to this very thin border between laughing and crying out of pure joy and gratitude. Gratitude that you have become so immensely strong and radiantly beautiful that I can feel it all the 2300km to Leuven&amp;hellip; You are vibrant with life, you are so pure, I just can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see you. I am counting the days, I am telling everyone that I meet that you will be coming next week, and it&amp;rsquo;s one of the reasons that make me randomly smile during the day. Actually I just came upstairs to my room after cooking with my friends and sitting with them for a while&amp;hellip; they were telling me that I definitely changed after Camino. That I&amp;rsquo;m more playful and energetic, that I enjoy even more to make stupid jokes and that I look (alas) even younger.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And still, there is some fear in me that you&amp;rsquo;ll be disappointed when you see me back&amp;hellip; Time on the camino has made you grow, I wish so much I could have made this journey too that it physically hurts me. Instead, real life continued for me – and even though I&amp;rsquo;m living life in a much more balanced way than I ever did, I am stagnating in growth&amp;hellip; I still wonder whether medicine is right for me, if it cannot allow me to grow further. Right now my plan is to finish my year, walk the Camino again and then decide. Sometimes I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m the only one awake in this world, the medical world. I see so many sleeping people and I would like to wake them all, but they just don&amp;rsquo;t listen, they only think I&amp;rsquo;m weird :) Which, to me, is a complement of course!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for writing to me, Phil, even when I don&amp;rsquo;t answer&amp;hellip; you have no idea how much I enjoy every word of your beautiful writing. You have such a talent&amp;hellip; When you come here, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you that I put some of your writing at the door of my room, to be able to read it every day :) Everything you write is so true, it comes right from your heart, and my heart recognizes ancient truth and pure joy in it, which is a lovely warm feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I love it that you discovered Cohen! He&amp;rsquo;s a real poet, someone who understood life. You&amp;rsquo;ll discover that at any time of your life, there&amp;rsquo;s always a song of his that guides you through. Thank you for the song! It went right to my playlist ;) Here&amp;rsquo;s a spanish poem to you:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Caminante no hay Camino&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Caminante, son tus huellas&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;el camino y nada más;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Caminante, no hay camino,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;se hace camino al andar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Al andar se hace el camino,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;y al volver la vista atrás&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;se ve la senda que nunca&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;se ha de volver a pisar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Caminante no hay camino&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;sino estelas en la mar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wayfarer, there is no path&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wayfarer, the only way&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is your footprints and no other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wayfarer, there is no way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make your way by going farther.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By going farther, make your way&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Till looking back at where you’ve wandered,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You look back on that path you may&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not set foot on from now onward.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wayfarer, there is no way;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Only wake-trails on the waters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I send you a big hug, and cannot wait to make it a real one…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;–Marieke&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>13: The Iron Cross</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/13c-ironcross/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/13c-ironcross/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;october-1st-2017---day-25&#34;&gt;October 1st, 2017 - Day 25&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dawn. A cast of silhouettes and gray clouds against the dark expanse. A string of headlamps clambering up a mountain. At the top, an iron cross.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The autumnal air invigorates me, my legs are weightless. I pass several pilgrims on my way up. Shanti is up ahead. I reach him and he smiles at me. We climb through the dark together, delighting in the thrill of the ascent. The Spaniard and I are at home here in the highlands of Galicia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Several pilgrims are gathered around a swell of stones. A wooden pillar protrudes from its center, and on top sits an iron cross. Perhaps it represents the relationship between earth and heaven, humanity and God. I’m tickled by the thought, but can’t help and feel a peculiar air of mysticism. The other pilgrims are gazing skyward.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I move closer and scan the assemblage of rocks and tokens. Necklaces, bracelets, beads, crumbled notes, a mangled hiking shoe, faded photographs, a teddy bear. On a rock, “CAMO AND MORELLO, 2017.” A woman in a headscarf approaches the altar, kneels, and sets the picture of who I think is a loved one between a rock and the foot of the pillar. She laces her fingers together, bows her head, and begins to cry.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;According to legend, pilgrims will carry a rock with them from the beginning of their journey and place it here at the base of this cross. The rock symbolizes the sins of the pilgrim, and the act of leaving it behind is supposed to clean the slate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I see it differently. To me, the rock represents all of the extra, unnecessary weight we carry with us through life – bitterness, resentment, fear, negativity, cynicism. The rock weighs us down. It prevent us from truly enjoying life, from tasting the joy and freedom inherent in being present. It chains us to the unforgiving, unrelenting storm of our past.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leaving the rock behind symbolizes our growth, it is the movement from there to here, an act of profound surrender. It is a letting go of the overplayed narratives that prevent us from creating a new story, from being who we want to be, from growing. It is the ultimate form of self-acceptance, and moving on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have a rock, but I did have my California license plate. I wasn’t planning to leave it, but the moment beckoned: the expiration date was October 2017, and today is the first day of October 2017. It&amp;rsquo;s a Sunday too, a day of reflection, beginnings, and endings. The plate is me, the old me. The struggle to find direction after college. The shitty first job. The search for belonging and meaning. The failed relationships. The insecurities. The fear of the unknown. It had to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I write Matilde’s, Franca’s, Stepan’s, and Marieke’s name on the plate. They had brought out and continue to foster the best parts of me. I place the plate against the base of the pillar, dismount from the heap, and walk on. Santiago is near.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/cross.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;september-28-2017---day-22&#34;&gt;September 28, 2017 - Day 22&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class = &#34;poem&#34;&gt;&#xA;* To be yourself–&#xA;* Easy to say, hard to do.&#xA;* What we think is not ours.&#xA;* What we believe is shaped by others.&#xA;* The only thing we own is&#xA;* what we feel.&#xA;* &amp;nbsp;&#xA;* Our inner compass, the way we connect with&#xA;* The outer world; only we can see and touch and&#xA;* Feel the way we do. Never lose it.&#xA;* Never let it go.&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Met Enrico and Sia today. Italian Photographer, Jewish Psychologist. Good vibes, good conversation. Talked about the nature of identity and self, meditation, instant gratification, feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to feel? To listen to what our heart has to say. –Sia&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The strangest thing happened while I was talking with Sia: the pain in my legs had suddenly disappeared! The sharpness in my hip, the knot in my foot, they vanished like a puff of air. I&amp;rsquo;m not complaining, but what exactly happened? It seems like the Camino has given me new legs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We got lost. We were supposed to stop in Hospital de Orbigo, but ended up at Villadangos del Paramo. We’re staying at an albergue called La Casa de Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s Enrico’s birthday, but he’s decided to cook for &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;. Risotto. I provided the wine, Sia the cake. A lovely American woman from California and a guy around my age from Washington D.C. joined our celebration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Enrico is cool. He’s genuine, contemplative, and expressive with his emotions and thoughts, all the while possessing a humble confidence that I truly admire. He was fascinated by what I had to say about psychology, meditation, and the creative process. I was captivated by the way he described the art of photography and his prior journey into the Swiss Alps. I wish he wasn&amp;rsquo;t leaving tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;september-29-2017---day-23&#34;&gt;September 29, 2017 - Day 23&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Meseta makes up ⅓ of the Camino. It’s a barren wasteland of wheat, desert, and more wheat. Not much to see, but it’s peaceful. Though I understand why people complain about it, or skip it entirely. The roads stretch for miles; it’s hot and arid; any sign of life appears to have been sucked dry. But what is a pilgrimage without a little bit of suffering?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve made it to the city of Astorga. Looking forward to the greenery, hills, and mountains of the Galicia region.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s beautiful here. There’s a large park nearby. I had a picnic with Mariam, a German girl who had only started her Camino a few days ago in Leon. She’s reserved and somewhat aloof. But nice. Wonder what was on her mind. We took a nap during Siesta. It’s a part of the Spanish culture – don’t work too hard, relax. America needs more Siesta.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sia and Enrico arrived later in the day. I found them in the kitchen cooking couscous. We had dinner together. It was Enrico’s last day on the Camino. I’ve only known him for a day, but he feels like a brother.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the evening, Enrico and I went to the park. The sound of snare drums, horns, and brass instruments filled the air. There were children playing music, perhaps practicing for a performance. They looked like they were having a lot of fun. Enrico took some pictures. We sat and listened for awhile, cherishing the moment. I felt happy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your presence, Enrico.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;september-30-2017---day-24&#34;&gt;September 30, 2017 - Day 24&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m in the Galicia region now. Mountains, vegetation, life surrounds me. I feel at home, up in the clouds and mountains. I saw a blackberry bush. It reminded me of M.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Met an energetic, charming American named Jackie.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Hey! You remind me of another beautiful young man I met just a few days ago.” I blushed – I am not so used to receiving compliments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back home, she’s a therapist. Said this was the first time in her life that she was taking care of herself and not others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s so amazing to be here. I haven’t thought about life back home at all! I’ve just been so focused on trying to take it all in, you know? Oh, look at that flower! Beautiful huh? My husband gets worried so he texts me every night, but I keep saying &amp;lsquo;I’m fine, I’m fine!&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A few days ago, I met this young woman from Australia – she looks about your age – who had decided to walk because her mother had recently died. She was so lost, she just wanted the pain to stop. On a whim she packed her things and started walking through Australia. And now she&amp;rsquo;s here. Still walking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But here’s the crazy part: she met a guy from Switzerland here. The kicker is that his mother had also recently died! And he was walking for the same reasons – all the way from Switzerland! Is that destiny or what? Now they&amp;rsquo;re inseparable. They&amp;rsquo;ve been walking together ever since.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Camino - there’s just something special about it. I believe in God, and I believe that he put them together for a reason. But, you could also say it was the Camino. It had provided them with what they needed most: a person who could understand their pain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m in Foncebadón. Met Terra and Kristen. Terra is from Nevada, and Kristen is from California. Also met a guy from Northern Spain, Shanti – he’s really cool. Shanti and I share a love for travel, mountains, the world. He’s a photographer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dinner was absolutely ludicrous. The hospitalero was a total control freak.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In donation-based albergues, pilgrims are expected to assist with dinner preparations and cleaning. But here, people were cutting vegetables in the “wrong” way. The hospitalero scoffed at them, then deicded to cut the vegetables himself; things had to be &lt;em&gt;perfecto&lt;/em&gt;. All-or-nothing. Apparently, no one was doing anything right, so he ended up preparing the entire dinner for all 18 of us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I thought it was hilarious but Terra and Kristen didn’t – they had been reprimanded by our fellow perfectionist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once we finished dinner, the hospitalero invited everyone to have &lt;em&gt;chupitos&lt;/em&gt; – shots – at the only bar in town.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Terra: “I thought he hated us, but now he’s buying everyone shots.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/shots.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>11: A Sea of Stars</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/11c-stars/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/11c-stars/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-21&#34;&gt;Day 21&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;4:30am. I inch out from my sleeping bag like a slug, careful not to disturb the others in the room, pack my things, and head downstairs. Pauline and Morgan are already awake. We’re late.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My eyes are crusty. I wolf down a prepacked sandwich – chorizo and cheese – with yogurt. Pauline makes us some coffee. Bland, but it will do. Shoes on, rucksacks shouldered, and we’re on the move.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The cold pierces through my layers. A creeping wave of goosebumps shivers down my spine. I’m in shorts because I lost my pants a week before. Ridiculous. My feet are sore. It takes thirty minutes of walking before the endorphins kick in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pauline is several paces ahead of Morgan and I. We exit town and walk into the twilight, guided by nothing more than the faint glow of a city encapsulated by a narrow crescent of light, a dim lantern flickering in the distance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pauline disappears into the darkness. We know she’s ahead, somewhere, but we don’t see her – we can’t. It’s just Morgan and I. We decide not to use our flashlights in order to see the stars. Flickers of movement perturb the corners of my vision. Rock and gravel crunch beneath the soles of our shoes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We’re walking on a long and narrow road along an empty highway. Two cars drive by and blind us with their highbeams. Morgan is close. I wonder if she’s scared of the dark. In the eastern quadrant of the sky, my eyes catch a streak of light. I lean my head back and gaze into the dark ocean, scanning. &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;A shooting star,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; Morgan whispers. I miss it. Another blazes by, and I catch it this time. Another, then another. I make a wish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I try to teach some English to Morgan. States. They’re like how countries are divided in Europe. &lt;em&gt;California, where I’m from, could definitely be 3 countries in Europe.&lt;/em&gt; She’s shy to speak, but tries anyways. She&amp;rsquo;s 22. She has an older brother. She graduated from university two years ago and works as a nurse in France. She’s currently on vacation. She likes dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tell her I have to stop and pee. She seems confused, but quickly realizes what I had meant as I scurry behind a tree and do my business. She continues on. Once I finish, I catch up and we walk in silent admiration of the night.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After 20 minutes or so, she has to pee too. She tells me I can continue, so I do. I then catch up to Pauline. She teaches me some colors in French: &lt;em&gt;noir, blanc, vert, bleu&lt;/em&gt;. I parrot them back and she laughs. “It’s cute, your accent,” she says. Morgan catches up, and we continue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Later in the afternoon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“TIMOOTHY!!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I turn around and spot my two favorite Germans, now on bicycles: Franca and Matilde. Matilde tells me her feet aren’t in great of shape, so they&amp;rsquo;ve bought bikes to compensate. They’re heading to Leon. Morgan, Pauline, and I consider following them. It’s an extra 10 kilometers on top of the 27 we’ve already walked. There’s a sharp pain in my hip joint and achilles, but we decide to go for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;10 kilometers later we’re in Leon. The height of hills and street curbs have become insurmountable. I wince in agony as I drag my legs through the city.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We reach the albergue. 38 kilometers total according to my FitBit, the longest distance I’ve walked yet. No Franca and Matilde though. They must be staying elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the dining room I see Gael, a Belgian I had met a week ago in another albergue. I tell him how far I’ve walked today. He grins and replies, &lt;em&gt;“Well if you’re tired, your face doesn’t show it!”&lt;/em&gt; I admire Gael&amp;rsquo;s positivity. &lt;em&gt;“When I am climbing the hills, I imagine that I am a bird flying over them; what is pain but weakness leaving the body; no matter what decision you make, you make it the best one; just smile and keep walking!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From his rucksack, he pulls out a large container of potato salad, a foot-long baguette, and a box filled with chocolate pastries. &lt;em&gt;“Have you eaten yet?”&lt;/em&gt; Pointing to the food, &lt;em&gt;“Here. Eat. Pilgrims need to eat after a long days walk, especially you. You need to eat so that you can become strong.”&lt;/em&gt; I tell him it’s too much that he&amp;rsquo;s offering, that he’s way too kind. &lt;em&gt;“No, no! You are helping me because there’s no way I can finish all of this. Also, you are helping me keep my pack very light. Please, eat.”&lt;/em&gt; I resist no longer, thank him, and feast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two days prior, I had found a stray T-shirt in the albergue I was staying at. It was dark navy-blue with a picture of a bull on its front.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After my meal with Gael, I shower and put the shirt on. While writing in a nearby cafe, an older American approached me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Hello. That’s a cool shirt. Where did you get it?”&lt;/em&gt; he asks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I found it a few days ago in my albergue. It was hanging from the corner of a chair. Everyone had already left, so I decided to bring it with me.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Well, you might not believe it, but that’s my shirt! It was a gift from my daughter for my birthday. She got it in Madrid.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Really? Well, you can totally have it back.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Are you sure? You can keep it if you need it.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Yeah of course! It’s your shirt. I don’t need it. I just grabbed it cause no one else was around. I’m sure it means a lot to you.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Thank you. It’s quite unbelievable that you&amp;rsquo;ve found it!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I run back to my albergue, throw on a different shirt, and return to the man. He asks to take a picture of me holding the shirt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I messaged my family about what just happened, and they just couldn’t believe it. Another miracle on the Camino.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/sea.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;september-23-2017---day-17&#34;&gt;September 23, 2017 - Day 17&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are always on the cusp of collapse and redemption. Do we choose to rise, or do we settle and fall?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stories = meaning. The mind is a meaning-making machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stories have the power to change people’s lives, and we are the narrators.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, a group of Americans invited me to their table at dinner. They were much older than me and asked a lot of questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I am walking alone. No, it’s not so bad. My feet are ok, I don’t have any blisters. Yeah, I get that often (“You smile a lot!”). Well, my parents weren’t too fond of the idea, but they couldn’t have stopped me even if they had wanted to. Eh, I don’t know if it’s brave, maybe naive and reckless is more accurate. I enjoy the freedom, the simplicity, the clarity of mind. I’ve been learning a lot about myself. Yeah, my friends are supportive. And funny you should ask, I met this girl from Belgium…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Oh my god. That is such a cute story. Are you going to visit her?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t thought of it. Maybe I should.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Phil, we had such a great time with you. You are a remarkable young man. Don’t worry about dinner, it’s on us. And tell your Mom that you met a bunch of older Americans, and that they’ve adopted you. Actually––.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer asked for my Mom’s number and sent her a picture of us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks Jennifer, Molly, Rex, Carlos, and Jackie.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;september-24-2017---day-18&#34;&gt;September 24, 2017 - Day 18&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A short day, 21 kilometers. It’s Sunday. I’ve stopped at the endearing municipal of Carrión de los Condes. Checked-in at the Santa Maria albergue. Three doors down toward the main street is the church.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thought about what Molly said last night, about visiting M. It’s audacious, but what the hell. As if the Camino wasn&amp;rsquo;t already bold enough. Why not?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I called Transavia and asked if they could refund my flight to Amsterdam. Luckily, they did. I now have a bus ticket from Paris to Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I returned from the grocery store, all of the pilgrims in the albergue were situated around the staircase in the living room. Four nuns were sitting in the front, one with a guitar. We took turns introducing ourselves and telling our reasons for walking the Camino.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was riveted by the story of an elderly Korean woman. She spoke into her translator and it said:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“A few years ago, I was diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease, but I wasn’t ready to lose my body. I chose to walk the Camino because of it. I wanted to prove everyone wrong. My family said I was crazy. But so far, I have walked for 300 kilometers, alone. I feel so alive, and I know that I am not alone because God is at my side. He continues to give me strength.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The nuns ended the night with music. They played their guitar and sang songs in English, Spanish, and Japanese! I was enchanted. These weren’t your traditional nuns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Wondering how Stepan is doing. Hope he’s feeling better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;september-25-2017---day-19&#34;&gt;September 25, 2017 - Day 19&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An observation: Every day that we wake and walk, the sun begins behind us, leaving us with only our shadow. This shadow represents our fears, insecurities, and struggles, the things we hesitate to look at in the eye; in essence, our inner demons. We wake each day to confront these demons as we walk towards Santiago. But we cannot get rid of them, because then we must get rid of the sun; no sun and the shadow becomes an engulfing abyss. Rather, we must fully accept the shadow, see it as it is, and nourish it with love. It will always be there so long as we are walk towards our Santiagos, so long as we walk with life, so long as we are trying to honor the inner light within each of us. Without light, life cannot exist, and life cannot exist without shadow. But that’s ok. Because at the end of the day, we are walking towards the sun, towards Santiago, and our shadow is now behind us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I met a French girl named Pauline while wandering around Terradillo de Templarios. She was walking to the next town, so I decided to accompany her until the edge of Terradillo. She&amp;rsquo;s been walking for over 1000 kilometers, all the way from Paris. Said she was feeling lost, but was ok with it. She wasn’t searching for anything, she simply enjoyed walking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While waiting for the shop to open, an older South Korean woman said I looked like a kind person. That made my day. She did also. I learned she was walking alone. She said the Camino had given her peace and a more full heart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve just had the most interesting dinner with an elderly woman named Elizabeth. She&amp;rsquo;s 72 years old, walking alone, German. Her eyes glimmered with maternal gentleness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was her and I at a small dining table in the restaurant. I started talking to her but soon realized she did not understand a single word. She spoke back in German, and I was just as confused as she. The curve of a wry smile formed on each of our faces as we humored the situation. She continued talking to me in German, and I continued responding in English.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then the wine came. Glass after glass, drink after drink, the wine flowed like a river. And pretty soon, we were bent over in laughter, pointing at nothings and waving our arms and legs in strange, unintelligible ways. I got drunk with an elderly 72-year-old German lady.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She showed me some pictures of her family, and I showed her mine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Ah, beautiful! Beautiful!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was a delightfully nonsensical and ridiculous time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;september-26-2017---day-20&#34;&gt;September 26, 2017 - Day 20&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How can you see the magic if you don&amp;rsquo; t believe in it?&#xA;It’s all around, in the trees, the grass, the flowers, the birdsong.&#xA;I see it in the sun, I taste it in the wind, I feel it with my smile.&#xA;This moment, this is it. An ocean of possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I ran into San! We haven’t seen each other since Day 1. Crazy. He looks great, and he’s found other friends – Karla, Dori, and Leo. Karla and Dori are from Croatia while Leo is from Czechia. They invited me to have dinner with them. Of course, I gladly accepted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, we went to watch the sunset. I was annoyed by Karla because she was constantly on her phone, talking and blabbering about essentially nothing. I decided to go to the other side of the park to watch it by myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I miss Marieke and her present presence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pauline. She’s here! In my room! She and her French friend, Morgan, are going to start walking tomorrow at 4:30am. They want to see some shooting stars and have invited me to tag along. I was initially hesitant but have agreed to go. Not sure what I&amp;rsquo;ve dragged myself into, but it should be good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/journal1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class = &#34;poem&#34;&gt;&#xA;* Each and every day I wake and walk with the sun.&#xA;* It starts low, climbing over hillsides, rising slowly.&#xA;* At last it finds its place in the sky&#xA;* and begins to color the Meseta.&#xA;* &amp;nbsp;&#xA;* Front and center a shadow grows.&#xA;* It looks at me with indifference – a mirror of my darker side.&#xA;* Fear, insecurity, doubt,&#xA;* The manifestation of my inner demons.&#xA;* &amp;nbsp;&#xA;* Each and every day, I wake and walk and confront them.&#xA;* If I fight and struggle, I hurt and suffer.&#xA;* If I push them away, I push myself away.&#xA;* I cannot hide, I cannot run,&#xA;* I can only bear witness.&#xA;* &amp;nbsp;&#xA;* Salvation lies within absence. &#xA;* But do I do it? Do I dare eclipse the sun?&#xA;* To turn from the shadows is to turn from truth.&#xA;* I would be swallowed whole.&#xA;* &amp;nbsp;&#xA;* My shadow is here,&#xA;* my shadow is me.&#xA;* So long as I walk the Way,&#xA;* it will keep me company.&#xA;* &amp;nbsp;&#xA;* I can&#39;t be scared&#xA;* I mustn&#39;t be afraid.&#xA;* I must continue on and on and on,&#xA;* moving toward the falling sun.&#xA;* &amp;nbsp;&#xA;* Each and every day, I wake and walk towards Santiago.&#xA;* The closer I get, the lighter I feel.&#xA;* The sun hangs low, peering over hillsides, descending slowly.&#xA;* Color fades from the Meseta, and my shadow is behind me.&#xA;* &amp;nbsp;&#xA;* Westward lies Santiago, and I look.&#xA;* The sun has set, the dark has settled.&#xA;* A fire begins to grow deep inside.&#xA;* It lights the valley and shows me the Way.&#xA;* I wake and walk toward the Light,&#xA;* closer and closer to Santiago.&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/ode.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>8: Gone</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/8c-gone/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve sunken into the depths of an all-too-familiar melancholy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She is gone. I am alone. My emotions are swinging to the erratic cadence of an unforgiving metronome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I miss the jade of her eyes, those luminescent opals I so often lose myself in. The ease of her smile, always able to bring about my own. The way she plucked those juicy blackberries from their thorny brambles, always a tad out of reach, the hem of her shirt lifting ever so slightly in the process, revealing the contours of a titillating landscape I secretly wished to explore.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I miss her laugh, her presence, the way she made me feel: Whole. Complete. Loved. I miss my Camino soulmate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Absence: the presence of nothingness. A paradoxical, palpable emptiness. A space defined by its non-existence. A torturous conundrum that slowly gnaws away the seam of my mind. A universe without incandescence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stepan has decided to stay another night in Burgos. He’s not taking the leave well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I, on the other hand, have to go. I have to keep walking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sky reflects my mood – gray, somber, displaced. I walk through a park between a row of trees. A runner waves at me and says, &lt;em&gt;“Buen Camino!”&lt;/em&gt; I force a smile and wave back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m lost. The hostel we stayed at was located somewhere deep within the city, far from the familiar path of the Camino. I need to find a yellow arrow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Google Maps leads me back on track, surprisingly. I spot a yellow arrow on a blue signpost pointing towards a stone bridge. A group of Spanish schoolchildren are crossing. I follow. They turn and smile at me. &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Un peregrino!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; This time an unforced grin wiggles its way to my lips. What I would do to be a child right now: they are experts at being present and letting go of things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The past 15 days I have walked with another. Now she’s gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A remnant of what was, a reminder of what isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I walk and continue on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the western edge of Burgos, I feel the presence of someone following me. I turn back and spot an older man trailing me not far behind. Some minutes later he appears at my shoulder, decelerates, and matches my pace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Ah, hello. You are young.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“No I’m Phil.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He does not laugh at my joke. He does not let me mope. We walk together for the next 2 hours. He&amp;rsquo;s a Korean Catholic priest on sabbatical. We proceed to talk about religion, the Camino, life. It&amp;rsquo;s refreshing to hear another voice, to have a moment of mental relief. Somehow he notices the heavy heart I&amp;rsquo;m carrying and asks why I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to walk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not sure anymore. I guess I was looking for a purpose, but I don&amp;rsquo;t even know if I believe in such a thing, as if such a thing existed &lt;em&gt;out there.&lt;/em&gt; Yet I feel like I have been going through life on a path that is not my own. Also, my best friend just left. We had been walking together for the past 2 weeks, and now she’s gone.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That must be hard&amp;hellip; Okay. let me ask you something: What are the most important things in your life?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“&amp;hellip;I&amp;hellip; I don’t know.” I felt ashamed for not knowing, but he reassured me:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry. Most people have answers right away. But they haven’t thought about why; why are those things important? It&amp;rsquo;s ok not to know. What makes you excited and happy?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Well… right now, walking. And I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying my conversation with you. I like to learn. I like to travel and meet people. Anything that makes me feel alive.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Ok, I see where you’re going with this.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s ok not to know. You don’t have to know where you’re going, you just have to keep going. And as long as you ask Why, you will go where you need to be. You might be searching for a clear answer, but it’s ok if you don’t find one by the end of your journey. Just keep asking Why, and be open to whatever comes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a child, I had the calling to become a priest. But I decided to go to university and studied architecture instead. I designed buildings - big ones, ah! - for almost 15 years. I thought it was what I wanted to do with my life. But something inside me told me it wasn’t. That was my heart speaking. It was still saying I had to become a priest. So I listened, and here I am! Ha ha.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But I don’t have a calling.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But you do. Callings! You just need to listen. Listen to your heart.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We go on like this for awhile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phil, can we take a picture together?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He took out his phone and snaps a selfie of us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I will always remember you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He laughs, quickens his pace, and walks off into the distance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I never see him again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;34 kilometers later I arrive in Hontanas. I check myself in, unpack, shower, and cook a light dinner. I wander around town for a bit, then go inside the church and sit in silence. I thought the presence of God would help me fill the void, but it didn’t. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t help non-believers, despite his supposed benevolence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I leave and clamber up a narrow flight of stairs behind the albergue. At the top is a swing-set and what looks like an abandoned bar. I continue upward toward the top of the hill until the people below are nothing more than ants. Barren hilltops and stretched clouds are lined against the distance. The sun is beginning its daily descent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why do I feel this way? I thought I could let her go. I thought I had accepted what was. Yesterday I was fine, today I&amp;rsquo;m not. What happened? Is this what it feels like to let go of something, someone you love? Do I though? Do I really love her?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I begin to vocalize my thoughts by talking to the sky, as if someone was listening to my grievances.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I accept it. Yes, I miss her. Maybe I do love her. I don’t know. What is love anyways? It’s so cliche. Boy meets girl in Spain. Falls in love. She flies away. And he lies to himself, tells himself he’s ok. He’s not&amp;hellip; I miss her.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A weight lifts as I shout into space. I laugh and imagine Marieke at my side, laughing with me, telling me how crazy of a person I am for talking to myself, shouting at nothing but the sun and clouds. But I knew she would understand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A latch releases. Gratitude, clarity, stillness, tears.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sky is poppy red, Marieke’s favorite flower and color, a deep and radiant crimson.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The journey has only just begun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/gone.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>7: Goodbye</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/7c-goodbye/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/7c-goodbye/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 15. We’re sitting amid a small gathering of dining tables in the main plaza of Burgos with a bottle of wine and plates of tapas. The patrons and pilgrims look happy, the cathedrals tower above us. I look up and ask myself: is there such a thing as a good goodbye?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Marieke looks content and tells her squirrel joke again. I try to listen, but my attention has been seized by the fact that she is leaving tonight. I sip my wine, and we continue talking. Stepan is with us. He strikes me as a winter wolf in human form. His hair is white like snow with splashes of gray. He’s observant and quiet. Does Marieke notice the way he looks at her? Or how I do too?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stepan and I book a hostel for the night. We want one night to ourselves away from the congested albergues of the Camino. We drop our things off and go to dinner at our favorite restaurant &amp;ndash; the one with the Falafel &amp;ndash; with Marieke.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hand Marieke the bus note I&amp;rsquo;d written for her. We replay every scene and memory of the days that have passed. They seem so long ago. She rests her head on my shoulder and we sit in silence, wishing for tomorrow to cease its advance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly Marieke spots our lanky Texan, Stefan, walking across the middle of the plaza. Matilde and Franca are beside him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We sprint toward the lovable Germans (and American), screaming their names in unison. I hurl myself onto Franca and give her the biggest hug of my life, nearly knocking over a nearby elderly couple. Their timing could be no more perfect. Home was calling to Marieke. She had found her answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;9pm. We’re in the bus station. Marieke is leaving. Marieke is really going home. I have her listen to “Soul Meets Body” by Death Cab for Cutie while Stepan stands away from us, searching for the bus, as if he were the one departing. Maybe he’s giving Marieke and I some space. Earlier he had said that he didn&amp;rsquo;t do goodbyes well. But who does?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bus finally arrives. Marieke and I embrace. Time bends. To our sentimental whims. To our refusal to let go of the present.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are desparately refusing a future in which &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; will be nothing more than a memory, a firing of indifferent, reforming neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It bends because we are fighting for the ineffable, for something so palpably insatiable, for what I have felt for the first time in my life: a pure kind of love, and the anticipation of its loss.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a love that feels expansive, all-encompassing, enrapturing. It digs deeper than traditional notions of romanticism, flies higher than the devout&amp;rsquo;s devotion to God, questions everything I thought I had understood. Time bends because we will not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bus parks. Travelers are hailed over. We let go. She boards. I look at her one last time. She looks back. The hint of a smile creeps over her lips like a facade.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The engine whirs to life, and the bus is wheeled into the dim tunnel. Time reclaims its throne.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Marieke and I walked together on the Camino for two weeks. Those weeks were some of the best in my life. Her energy and enthusiasm for life was unmatched. Every blackberry she ate, every sip of coffee she had, every conversation we held was something to be cherished. She taught me that only by giving oneself up to life could life be fully lived.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re sad, feel sad. Happy, feel happy. Whatever it is, don’t push it away.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Having emotions just means you’re alive!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To her life was a privilege, not a birthright, and she embraced it with every ounce of her being.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One week in, she said I had become her best friend. And when she said this, I started imagining all kinds of romantic fantasies and happy endings between us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Hey children, your ol’ Gramps met this lovely lady 35 years ago while walking across Spain! It was destiny!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, cool story bro, but I met my love on the Camino.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet what we had was so much deeper than that. To her my insecurities, fears, and struggles were valid parts of me. And yet, in comparison to my strengths as a human, they were wholly insignificant. She appreciated, awed at, and encouraged my child-like curiosity, the way I saw the world, and the purity of being she believed me to possess. “You have something special to give to the world.” She was relentless in her attempts of making me believe in myself. And I began to. I continue to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a natural human impulse to try and define our experiences and relationships by the narratives we&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated over the course of our lifetime. Sometimes though those boxes are too narrow. They&amp;rsquo;re limited by what we&amp;rsquo;ve seen and been exposed to in the past. They fail to capture or miss entirely the nuances and brevity of new and profound experiences. Some things are best left undefined. Love is one of those things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/goodbye.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Phil! I have a genius idea. You’re really going to like it.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s day 12. Marieke, Stepan (a walker from The Czech Republic we met a few days ago), and I go to the top of a hill to catch the sunset. We sift through an amber field of grass and wheat and settle ourselves in a small circular clearing. The sky is cloudless, a cool breeze is present.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We talk for awhile, about what I can&amp;rsquo;t remember, but I feel wonderfully content. When the sun begins its descent into the horizon, we are overcome by the growing silence of the landscape. The birds are chirping louder and louder with every passing minute, almost as if they were calling to their friends, “Come! The miracle is happening again!” Then their voices disappear. Layer by layer, the orange and pinkish hues fade into the dark absolute of space and night while the stars took their place against the blackened sky.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Hey Marieke, can I share something with you?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Yes?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wrap my arm around her and pull her close.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“My body heat.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She presses her body closer to mine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You are so incredibly lame.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Marieke always finds the joy in every moment. Every time we come across a blackberry bush, she stops to eat a few, halting everyone with her. Eyes closed, body perked, each bite was a delicacy. Every coffee and tortilla was always the best coffee and tortilla she ever had.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I turn and ask her what the secret is to enjoying life. She laughs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Oh it’s so simple, Phil.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Is it though?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is not something you can do with the mind, it is something you feel.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Well that&amp;rsquo;s not helpful,&amp;rdquo; I jab. &amp;ldquo;What if I can&amp;rsquo;t feel it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t be silly. Just let go and listen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, she had nearly committed suicide. She was a student in a rigorous doctorate program for engineering. She hated it. She felt that she didn&amp;rsquo;t belong. It just wasn’t for her, yet she desperately tried to claw her way through. To cope with the stress, she stopped eating for days at a time – it got her mind off the engineering. After months of this, her body could no longer handle the starvation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the hospital, she told her family that she was going to walk the Camino (this would be her first one). Everyone said she was crazy to even think of such an idea in her current state. But she ignored them and flew to Spain. A greater force was beckoning: the need to save herself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With each passing day and every continued footstep, she grew emotionally, physically, and mentally stronger. Lightness, joy, and gratitude began to inhabit her soul. Food tasted good again, indescribably good, so much so that she would often be brought to tears while eating.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was then that I understood why every tortilla, coffee, and blackberry was the best thing in the world to her: when faced with death, life and its constitutes become an indispensable gift. The best days were the ones in which she was alive and well enough to savor it. I wondered if it takes such a close encounter to death to acknowledge the beauty of what is right before us. I certainly could&amp;rsquo;ve used the shift in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When she reached Santiago, she fell to her knees and cried. She had proven her family wrong. She had made it. And she had found a reason to live.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After telling us her story, I pull out my phone, open up my notes, and read her &amp;ldquo;The Journey&amp;rdquo; by Mary Oliver:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class = &#34;poem&#34;&gt;&#xA;* One day you finally knew&#xA;* what you had to do, and began,&#xA;* though the voices around you&#xA;* kept shouting&#xA;* their bad advice–&#xA;* though the whole house&#xA;* began to tremble&#xA;* and you felt the old tug&#xA;* at your ankles.&#xA;* &#34;Mend my life!&#34;&#xA;* each voice cried.&#xA;* But you didn&#39;t stop.&#xA;* You knew what you had to do,&#xA;* though the wind pried&#xA;* with its stiff fingers&#xA;* at the very foundations,&#xA;* though their melancholy&#xA;* was terrible.&#xA;* It was already late&#xA;* enough, and a wild night,&#xA;* and the road full of fallen&#xA;* branches and stones.&#xA;* But little by little,&#xA;* as you left their voices behind,&#xA;* the stars began to burn&#xA;* through the sheets of clouds,&#xA;* and there was a new voice&#xA;* which you slowly&#xA;* recognized as your own,&#xA;* that kept you company&#xA;* as you strode deeper and deeper&#xA;* into the world,&#xA;* determined to do&#xA;* the only thing you could do--&#xA;* determined to save&#xA;* the only life you could save.&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No words could express the gratitude I felt in that moment. I felt thankful that she was alive and with us in a cold field somewhere in Spain. Stepan eventually caved and accepted our invitation to share body heat under the cool night sky.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Why did the universe bring us all together?” I ask.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but I believe that everything happens for a reason,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; said Marieke.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think to myself: &amp;ldquo;What if we&amp;rsquo;re the ones who make those reasons?&amp;rdquo; then let the thought go. In the moment it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether we are living a truth or a fiction. The story is ours to write.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/roses.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>5: The Cusp of Time and Infinity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the morning we walk to Pamplona, our first city. I run into Maria and chat with her for a brief moment before running off with the girls for breakfast. I didn’t know it then, but that would be my final conversation with her. One thing the Camino teaches you, by nature of necessity, is how to let go. People, places, your past. The present demands it be so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We stop at a small bakery near the entrance of the city. The owners are friendly, the chocolate and pastries delectable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/cusp.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the first day I distance myself from the group. At our usual lunch time, I decide to continue walking. I feel the need to recenter myself, to have some alone time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I tell the girls and they understand – they encourage it – and I walk on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The landscape opens, and I can see for miles on end in every direction. Small farms and grainy fields, naked mountains and green hilltops populating the horizon. As I walk into the vastness, I feel a growing sense of calm, a clarity of mind, and a strengthening of my body and soul.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/cusp1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I reach Zariquiegui much sooner than expected. Marieke arrives shortly after as do Matilde and Franca, and we check into a small albergue attached to a small bar. We reconvene outside and chat over drinks. I&amp;rsquo;m drinking red wine, Marieke has her milk, Franca and Matilde their beers. Afterwards we separate again and explore town on our own. I walk up a small hill overlooking Zariquiegui, write, and meditate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On my way back down, I catch sight of Marieke sitting on a curb listening to music. I go over and ask if I can join. She tells me the music she listens to is unusual and &lt;em&gt;“not fit for American ears&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;, but she eventually concedes her right earbud. The melodies are soothing and enjoyable, but I don&amp;rsquo;t understand a single word – it is all in French.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After dinner, the girls and I climb a hill at the edge of town and lay on the grass for awhile, gazing at stars, telling stupid jokes, enjoying our newfound friendship. In the distance, tiny orbs of light give shape to the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want the moment to end. We are all high on life, strangers united by foreignness, drinking from the cusp of time and infinity, somewhere in the depths of a beautiful and wonderfully dark universe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/cusp2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>4: Möge die Straße</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another gray and rainy day. We sleep in and start walking at 8am. After the deep and enlightening conversations of yesterday, we decide to walk in solitude –– together but left to the vicinity of our inner worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My feelings throughout the morning are in contrast with the highs of the previous. I am in a blue, melancholic state of mind. Thoughts of the future, about something out of reach. What if I return unchanged? What if the Camino turns out to be a waste of time?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m annoyed at myself for having these thoughts, though I don’t push them away. I try to listen and see them as they are – thoughts with no actual bearing on reality, despite how real they feel in the moment. Acknowledged, their presence simply fades, and I am able to resume my walk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After 2 hours of trekking, we stop at a small cafe and break our vow of silence. And lucky us! The solitude has given us time to generate new insights and thoughts, while the distance fueled a burning desire for each other&amp;rsquo;s company. It was like we were seeing old friends again after years of prolonged separation, and we enjoy each minute as if they were our last.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/strasse1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We continue our walk, though without much of the silence. I walk with Matilde this time while Franca and Marieke are a few paces ahead of us. Something seems to be on Matilde’s mind, so I inquire.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Matilde has just graduated from high school and is taking the year off before applying to university. This is her first time being away from home. At the bus station in Bayonne, right before she and Franca had met me, she had a mental breakdown. Not only was she adjusting to the fact that she was far from home, she was also about to walk across a completely unknown, unfamiliar country. But she understands that what she is experiencing is just a small part of growing up. It may even be all of it - constantly facing the unknown. She knows she will be fine, she says, especially in good company.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We transition and begin talking about a variety of topics: destiny, fate, family, love, books. I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to discover that she is also a voracious bibliophile. We&amp;rsquo;re excited to learn that Cloud Atlas is a shared favorite. Most people have heard of and seen the movie, but it was much less likely that they had read the book. The prose is lucid but dense. What are the odds of meeting someone on the Camino who has actually read the book? Is there a reason behind the sudden entwinement of our universes, like that of the six protagonists of Cloud Atlas?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before meeting, Matilde thought my name was Timothy: &lt;em&gt;“You just looked like a Timothy, so Franca and I decided to call you Timothy.”&lt;/em&gt; I flipped out because my Dad&amp;rsquo;s name is Timothy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We could have dismissed these moments as a series of mere coincidences. But we didn&amp;rsquo;t. Where&amp;rsquo;s the fun in that? We, as humans, have the power to write our own narratives through the meaning we give to our shared experiences. We are both the playwrights and the actors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s the script: Etched in the starry cosmos was the eventual convergence of two seemingly disparate universes, that of Matilde and Phil, on the 10th day of a gray and rainy September in the year of 2017 on the Camino de Santiago. There was fun. There was connection. There was joy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We end our walk at a quiet donation-based albergue some few kilometers away from the city of Pamplona. The albergue has a calm and inviting atmosphere. On the walls are colorful plates and pictures, paintings of pilgrims, various cultural articles. My favorite is a poster with the word love transcribed in multiple languages, likely written by past pilgrims who had also found refuge here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After unpacking and cleaning myself up, I go downstairs into the kitchen and meet a pilgrim named Maria. She&amp;rsquo;s from Oregon and has recently retired from working as a speech therapist and professor. To celebrate she had decided to walk the Camino. We start talking and I tell her I&amp;rsquo;m searching for direction, that I feel quite lost and unsure of what I want in life. She listens attentively and makes room for me to vent my thoughts. When I finish, she smiles and reassures me the way a loving mother does.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Don’t worry. You’ll figure it out as you go. Everyone walks their own path. You need to be practical, yes, but you also need to listen to your heart. That’s why you’re here now. Just keep walking and listen to what it says.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the evening, the girls and I go inside the church behind the albergue and ring the infamous bell at the top of its tower. It is the only bell allowed to be rung by pilgrims on the Camino. Afterwards we go downstairs and find a small shrine of Jesus covered with green sticky notes. On them are the words of many past pilgrims, mostly notes of gratitude. Matilde, Franca, Marieke, and I add our own to the collection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later on we share a dinner with the others – more pasta, salad, wine. Once we finish, we head into the church again for a short reflection led by the nuns who run and maintain the albergue. We sit in a small circle, and each of us shares who we are and, voluntarily, why we are walking the Camino.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a man walking with his young son, James, the young woman to my left is searching for new sources of meaning, and Maria is walking in celebration of her long and rich life. I consider the question and give my own answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To end the night, Matilde and Franca are asked to sing a song. They decide to sing an Irish blessing, Möge die Straße, in German. It was something they sang at the end of every school year before departing into the bliss of summer vacation. The setting is perfect. We have no sense of what adventures, trials, and lessons lay ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;möge-die-straße&#34;&gt;Möge die Straße&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class = &#34;poem&#34;&gt;&#xA;* May the road rise to meet you&#xA;* May the wind be always at your back&#xA;* May the sun shine warm upon your face&#xA;* The rains fall soft upon your fields&#xA;* &amp;nbsp;&#xA;* And until we meet again, until we meet again&#xA;* May God hold you in the palm of his hand&#xA;* And until we meet again, until we meet again&#xA;* May God hold you in the palm of his hand&#xA;* &amp;nbsp;&#xA;* May the sun make your days bright&#xA;* May the stars illuminate your nights&#xA;* May the flowers bloom along your path&#xA;* Your house stand firm against the storm&#xA;* &amp;nbsp;&#xA;* And until we meet again, until we meet again&#xA;* May God hold you in the palm of his hand&#xA;* And until we meet again, until we meet again&#xA;* May God hold you in the palm of his hand&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/strasse2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>3: Tea</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/3c-tea/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/3c-tea/</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class = &#34;poem&#34;&gt;&#xA;* Through the window I see&#xA;* Sun-bathed flowers and untouched rock,&#xA;* Blades of grass and untrodden walks,&#xA;* Endless possibility.&#xA;* &amp;nbsp;&#xA;* I ask of you Time&#xA;* To yield your determined hand&#xA;* So I may dance&#xA;* Forever with Infinity.&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I run into Matilde and Franca while departing from Roncesvalles. They&amp;rsquo;re heading in the opposite direction, back toward the albergue, when they call out to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Phiiiiilll! Heeeey we’re gonna make some tea! Would you like to join us?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to walk on, but the words of a hospitalero echo in my mind: &lt;em&gt;The Camino will give you everything you need. Surrender to the Way.&lt;/em&gt; Be open to what comes your way. Say yes to life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We go back inside and attempt to make tea. Matilde and Franca fiddle with the stove while I watch and provide moral support. Unfortunately the stove is beyond the abilities of my fellow Germans, so I give the task a go myself. I fail miserably and leave to find Matilde and Franca. They&amp;rsquo;re chatting with a young woman near the vending machines in the adjacent kitchen. She&amp;rsquo;s beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I introduce myself and join the conversation. The woman&amp;rsquo;s name is Marieke. She&amp;rsquo;s from Belgium and is excited about the fact that we we&amp;rsquo;re young like her and speak fluent English. Franca and Matilde go back into the kitchen, leaving Marieke and I to each other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Marieke is in her 2nd year of medical school. She&amp;rsquo;s on the Camino seeking balance, answers. It&amp;rsquo;s her 3rd one, though she has never walked its entire length. Her acute sense of self-awareness, her lively buoyancy, her attentive hazel eyes catch me off guard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The day is gray and rainy, a complete contrast to the sun-painted stroll of the prior. We decide it&amp;rsquo;s best to walk together.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I walk with Marieke while Matilde and Franca trot in unison a few meters ahead of us. Marieke is wearing a clear, plastic trashbag she claims is a poncho. &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s not a poncho, that&amp;rsquo;s a trash bag!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; It takes her awhile to warm up to my humor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once we&amp;rsquo;re beyond the formalities, Marieke and I begin to talk about every imaginable topic a human-being like me loves: psychology, purpose, meaning, meditation, freewill, learning, being human. Eventually we exchange the intellectual brevity for emotional depth: we talk about pain and love, relationships and ourselves, the finitude of our time in this world. We get vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not long before I realize that I am growing attracted to her. I try to brush it off because I don’t want to feel this way – &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;this is not why I&amp;rsquo;m here,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; I remind myself. But love and attraction don&amp;rsquo;t quite adhere to our more sensible selves, and I am reminded to surrender to the Way. &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Camino will give you everything you need,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; echoes the Hospilatero. But was this something I needed?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As we walk on, I become increasingly aware of the beauty surrounding us: the colors and smells, the rhythm of my footsteps, the movements of nature. My senses are heightened, I feel incredibly alive. Marieke too is captivated –– by the droplets of water hanging from the leaves, by the dewy smell of the moist air, by the simple joy inherent in the freedom of bodies in motion. Before we know it, we arrive in Zubiri.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The single shower in our albergue is occupied. Matilde and Marieke inform me that there&amp;rsquo;s a shared shower space in the other building. I&amp;rsquo;ve never showered with anyone else before and felt shy about the prospect, but I go, believing that it would be unoccupied since we had arrived later in the day. As I make my way toward the building, I see another young pilgrim walking toward it too, clean clothes and a small bottle of shampoo in hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Oh boy. I’m going to have to shower with another dude. Wait, there must be stalls. Yeah, it’s all good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are no stalls. Only a long aisle with a single curtain hiding a row of shower-heads.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We go inside. He acknowledges me with a quick head-nod, and I nod back. We step into the aisle. I turn my back to him and began to take off my clothes. He does the same, I think. I&amp;rsquo;ve claimed one corner and he the other. And then we start showering, no more than six meters apart. I take my time, hoping that he will finish before me. He must’ve had the same thought, because we are both standing there for what seems like eternity, showering together in silence, the only sound being the clashing of water against exposed skin. Finally I make the first move and finish my shower. He continues. I dry myself off, put my clothes on, and scurry away from the building.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I report my experience to the girls. They&amp;rsquo;re hysterical. Later I see him again, and we give each other a quick nod of acknowledgement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“A man on the Camino told me he was walking because he wanted to find peace: peace with himself. Peace with nature. Peace with God.” – Marieke&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the evening the girls and I go to the local bar. There we run into Stefan, the tall, lanky, 18-year-old Texan. He&amp;rsquo;s been drinking since 2pm and is clearly inebriated. We eat pizza - Spanish pizza! - and banter on about our respective home countries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Marieke leaves early to catch some alone time, and I go to do the same. Back in the albergue, I reflect on the day and write in my journal. Later I find Marieke sitting in the corner of the kitchen, perhaps also writing about her day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I talk to a woman in her 60s from the States. We exchange some stories, she about her career and children, I about my recent adventures and worries regarding the future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She reassures me &lt;em&gt;“It&amp;rsquo;ll work itself out, so don’t worry so much. Hell, I’m still learning how not to.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I never grow tired of telling my stories to different people. Each retelling refines or redefines the meaning I derive from my experiences. I thank the woman for listening and sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Franca and Matilde return from the bar, and we join Marieke in the corner of the kitchen. Later we enjoy a community dinner with the other pilgrims, and when the wine has settled in our bodies, we retreat to our room and dream of the coming day. More walking, more talking, more living. It is enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/tea.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>2: First Ascent</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wake up to the sound of creaking bunk beds, rustling backpacks, and hushed chatter. It&amp;rsquo;s 5:30 a.m. &lt;em&gt;Time to go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s small talk of good weather and stellar walking conditions. Free bread as stiff as stones. I devour as much of it as I can and head out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first day is supposed to be arduous: 27 kilometers from Saint-Jean to Roncesvalles, with a gradual gain of 1400 meters in elevation. It&amp;rsquo;s dark, cold, and misty out. I equip myself with a smile, shoulder my rucksack, and begin to put one foot in front of the other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For most of the morning I walk along a narrow road populated by small farms and modest homes. A constant stream of white vans is driving by, presumably transporting those who are daunted by the unavoidable ascent over the Pyrenees, or those who are physically incapable. The air stinks of manure and wheat, though I feel invigorated by a sense of new beginnings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After 5-6 kilometers of walking in the twilight, I reach the base of the Pyrenees. I allow myself a short break, then began the ascent. As I climb higher into the sky, the sun is rising to fulfill its daily task. Clumps of green become blades of grass, darkness turns to shadow, cowbells and birdsong fill the air. The landscape is awakening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sheer variety of walkers amazes me. Young and old, American and Canadian, English and Irish, German, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Korean, Japanese… the list is endless.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to discern those who are on vacation from those who are in search of something greater. The vacationers often walk in couples or groups. Their conversations are light, suffering is a force to be avoided, they lack a spiritual connection to the Camino. Conversely, the seekers usually walk alone. They connect with other soloists and seekers, their suffering is meaningful, the Camino has called to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, these are only superficial observations. A person could be walking for deeply personal reasons, but had decided to go with others because they are simply terrified of walking alone. And certainly there&amp;rsquo;s the spiritual bunch who act like hound dogs on a life-or-death mission. They often lose sight of the very thing they&amp;rsquo;re seeking. It was sometimes right under their noses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I arrive at Refuge Orisson two hours later, an albergue 8 kilometers west of Saint-Jean. I take a break and buy myself another round of breakfast – espresso with a Spanish tortilla. The mountainous air feels cool and refreshing, the views from the terrace stunning. I fill my lungs and exhale slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/orr.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back on the road, I am greeted by a cheery social worker from South Korea named San. He doesn’t speak much English, but when he does it&amp;rsquo;s usually in a positive tone. I like jim a lot and he always laughs at my jokes. I wonder if he even understands them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later we meet another South Korean named Jackie. She worked in hospitality for a year before deciding that she was dissatisfied with her life. I sense that she&amp;rsquo;s a seeker, and unlike San, her English is fluent. She comprehends my jokes but doesn’t laugh at them the way San does. Regardless, we welcome her company and walk together for the next two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Solitude exists only in stolen moments during the early stages of the Camino. San and Jackie need a break, so I continue on without them, knowing that we will reconnect in Roncesvalles.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A continual stream of pilgrims take their place. It&amp;rsquo;s overwhelming at times, all the &amp;lsquo;Buen Caminos!&amp;rsquo; and fleeting conversations. I appreciate their earnest attempts to connect, but there are moments when I just want to be alone with the scenery. That is something I am still trying to learn: how to accept and be open to the unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I arrive at Roncesvalles early in the afternoon. It’s a small town with two restaurant-bars, a hotel, and a gothic monastery that accommodates 200 or so pilgrims. After checking in, I idle in the courtyard, call my parents, and write in my journal. Later Jackie and I grab a drink at the local bar to celebrate our first full day of walking. Afterwards we go to the nearby restaurant for dinner with some of the other pilgrims.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The standard pilgrim meal consists of an appetizer, the main dish, and dessert, which is always accompanied by a bottle of red wine. Always. At the end of the night our tongues are loose, and we begin to exchange stories of who we are, where we came from, why we are walking the Camino.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Spanish couple at our table has recently returned to Spain after having lived in London for several years, stating that life in the city was too complicated. They prefer the simple lifestyle of Spain, and they are walking the Camino to celebrate their homecoming. Another man from Italy shares that he has been walking the Camino every year for the past five years. He likes the perspective he gains and the people he meets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Everyone has a story to share on the Camino. I come here to learn and listen,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After dinner, I retreat to my bunk bed and write about the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Walking in unknown territory nourishes me. I feel alive and powerful, small and humbled beneath the Spanish skies. Perhaps I am here to write the next chapter of my story, to rediscover and map the terrain of my heart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I check the contents of my rucksack again. Three outfits and two pairs of socks. A sleeping bag and a down jacket. Phone charger, toiletries, another set of shoes in addition to my boots. Just in case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Emergency medical supplies for three days. My 1-liter nalgene bottle is filled to the brim. My California license plate––the only item of sentimental value. A journal and my writing tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I take a deep breath.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Trepidation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I let it go, slowly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Excitement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two sides of the same coin, and I am standing on the precipice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/road.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>1: Beginnings</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Camino de Santiago is a network of pilgrimage routes that ultimately converge on the city of Santiago de Compostela in Northwestern Spain, where the great Saint James is rumored to be buried.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I walked the most popular route, the Camino Frances. It begins at Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port in Southern France, a small city located north of the Pyrenees, and totals about 500 miles across Spain to the city of Santiago de Compostela. Many walk the Camino for spiritual and religious reasons. I walked in search of myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Getting on the Camino is a challenge in and of itself. Since my starting point was Saint-Jean, I had to take a flight from Charles de Gaulle to Biarritz –– a small city in Southwestern France –– and from Biarritz a bus to the nearby city of Bayonne, and from there another bus to Saint-Jean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I made my first two friends while waiting in line to board the plane in Charles de Gaulle. There was a tap on my shoulder, and I turned around to meet Jim and Kathy, a genial, retired couple from Truckee, California. They believed that life was too short to be lived at the wayside. Retirement and old age should enable one’s life, they said, not inhibit it. So they decided to walk the Camino.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once we were in Biarritz, we had to catch a bus to Bayonne. Being a naive traveler, I didn’t have any euros yet to pay for my ticket, and a currency exchange was nowhere to be found. I returned to the bus stop, and Jim noticed my concerned expression. I told him I had no euros. He laughed and casually handed me enough for the ride. I was surprised by his generosity and thanked him. Jim and Kathy smiled back. Their sharp blue eyes radiated with youth and sincerity. I felt as if the Camino were conspiring to make my journey possible, as if I were integral to the writing of some larger story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I met my second pair of friends, Franca and Matilde, the 18-year-old German duo, while waiting in Bayonne. It began with a simple request:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Hallo! Do you mind watching our stuff while we use the toilet?” Matilde asked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Yeah! Of course,” I replied. But toilet? Was this some form of European vernacular for bathroom? (Yes)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bus finally arrived and we were on our way to Saint-Jean. I sat in the back of the bus where I had a panoramic view of the Pyrenees mountains. The sun-bathed ridges pierced the clear blue skies, reminding me of my many hikes in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. The shadows of leaves formed, disappeared, and reemerged in rapid oscillations on my body as we drove through the valley, a simple play of light that delighted my eye.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I directed my attention back into the bus and took notice of the people before me. Matilde and Franca were sitting near the front next to a tall, lanky Texan who I later learned was Stefan. I then turned my gaze toward Jim and Cathy. Jim was resisting Cathy’s attempts to straddle him. He looked somewhat embarrassed, but I knew he was reveling in the moment. Their eyes spoke of a timeless love.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After an hour or so we arrived in Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port, the official starting point of the Camino Frances. In the near distance stood the Pyrenees, the grand guardians of the city, and on the other side was Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Along the length of the Camino, there are hundreds of yellow arrows marked on walls, tree stumps, and signposts. Their sole purpose is to lead the pilgrim toward Santiago de Compostela, the end destination of the Camino. So long as you followed the arrow, you were presumably going the right way. To trust the arrow is to make a connection with all of the past pilgrims who had already embarked on the journey. It is the first leap of faith on the Camino.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Upon arriving in Saint-Jean, my first task was to obtain a credencial. It was required to stay in the albergues –– the pilgrim hostels –– and, if you cared for it, for the certificate of completion in Santiago. I followed a trail of yellow arrows into Saint-Jean, found the Pilgrim’s Office, and received my first stamp.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had booked an albergue in advance, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t open yet, so I went to explore Saint-Jean. The cobblestone roads were furnished by a myriad of markets, sandwich shops, charcuteries, restaurants and kiosks. Plastered on their fronts was the notorious scallop shell of the Camino. The shell represents the idea that all paths eventually lead to Santiago. This struck me as a rich metaphor for life: wherever we are going, whatever path we are on, we will always be lead to Truth, God, oneself, death. Maybe there is no wrong path in life, so long as we kept walking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The albergue opened at 4 in the afternoon. Once inside the other walkers and I were greeted by a man who could have been characterized as the Yoda of the Camino. He was our hospitalero, the person in charge of running the albergue. Before checking us in, he sat us down and told us a few things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“When you wake up tomorrow,” he began, “and you want to make yourself a cup of coffee, please make sure to give the machine only one euro. Not two, or five. One! Why? Because –– and please excuse my French –– the machine is a whore! It will take your change and not give it back. So if you want coffee before you walk, give it only one euro please. Unless you like losing your money.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Laughter fills the room.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“One more thing. Listen. For many of you, this is your first Camino. You will get blisters. You will feel pain. You will have days when you want to cry, give up, and go home. But don’t. The Camino will provide for you and care for you. Surrender to it. It will give you everything you need –– but not always everything you want, eh? There’s a difference. Trust the Camino. Listen to it. Have faith in it. Let it guide you. Surrender to the way.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Ok. So who’s ready to check in?”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/begin.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>0: Introduction: Walking El Camino de Santiago</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/0c-introduction/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In May of 2017, while working in a Title I Elementary school in New Hampshire, I read a little fable called &amp;ldquo;Rebirth&amp;rdquo; by Kaval Ravikant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main character, Amit, is unable to return home after the death of his estranged father. He wanders, lost and filled with pain and grief, and is led to the Camino de Santiago. There he meets many travelers and pilgrims. Some are lost and searching for answers, others are running from their past, all have a story to share. Along the month-long journey, he is faced with the big questions of life, causing him to grow in a new direction and way of being.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Upon finishing the story, the seeds of the Camino were planted in my mind. &amp;ldquo;I will walk the Camino one day,&amp;rdquo; I thought. And perhaps by fate, just when I needed them to bloom, the seeds came to fruition 3 months later at a summer camp in Maine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;summer-camp-maine&#34;&gt;Summer Camp, Maine&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had just finished my year of service with City Year, New Hampshire. The plan afterwards was to attend Boston University for a graduate program in Educational Leadership and Policy Studies, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like a good fit for me, so I withdrew my application and, with little time for decisions and no alternatives in sight, took a job as a camp counselor in Maine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the second week of camp I applied for a job in Colorado, confident of my ability to secure the position. I was rejected days later. It then become clear to me that I had no sense of direction in my life. I had nearly accepted an offer to go to graduate school because it seemed like the right thing to do, and I had applied to a random job in Colorado because I yearned for a sense of security.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What was I willing to work for? What did I really want to do with my life? How did I want to live? These questions haunted me, beckoning for some form of resolution, yet I had no answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I turned to books for guidance - my usual coping strategy - and reread The Alchemist and When Breath Becomes Air. The Alchemist inspired a dreamy sense of possibility while Breath instilled a demanding urgency. But neither resolved the growing existential angst in me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks later, like a godsend, the idea of walking the Camino came to mind. The sensible me thought the idea was impulsive and irresponsible: what if it&amp;rsquo;s a waste of time? Was I only avoiding my problems? Was I choosing to run away? In the end my gut ignored these worries and made the decision for me: I went to the farmhouse - the only place with internet access at camp - and bought a one-way ticket to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A funny thing began to happen once my mind had settled on the decision: life got better. Once I had finally committed to something, my capacity to fully experience the moment grew as I settled into the present. Camp became a pure source of joy as I reveled in the interplay of Maine&amp;rsquo;s idyllic landscapes, the slow passage of time, and the high-pitched screams of happy campers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On one of our last nights off, some of the Hungarian staff and I decided to camp in Acadia National Park. We pitched our tents beneath a sky full of stars and pine trees, lit a fire, and feasted on cheap chips, beer, and wine. The smell of bacon and campfire filled the air. I turned toward my foreign friends, then to the grand night sky. It felt as if the universe was watching over me, and I entrusted my future to it. I believed that everything would work itself out and let go of the incessant desire to control everything. In the warm arms of the sublime, I felt light, free, happy, and loved. I felt infinite, like Charlie the wallflower.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/camp-kiddo.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-woods-of-maine&#34;&gt;The Woods of Maine&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the last day of camp, I paddled out to the middle of Echo Lake and sat amid the glossy water, wondering what to make of the whole experience, contemplating how the future would unfold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was my birthday, August 10th. &amp;ldquo;Not much has changed but me,&amp;rdquo; I thought. &amp;ldquo;I am the same person as I was yesterday, only now I have the number 24 plastered to my identity.&amp;rdquo; I was no longer 23, 15, or 10. Yet in some sense, I was: I was still the flippant adolescent of 14, the bashful child of 7, the confused adult of 18 to 23. How was I to define 24?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wrote a promise to myself:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This life you have before you is the only certainty. Don&amp;rsquo;t take it for granted. Own it and live it with meaning, beauty, courage, grace, and presence. Dare to dream. Spend it with people you love, spend it loving people. Be heartbroken, be brave, make mistakes. Do all of the things that scare the shit out of you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/camp.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once camp was over, I drove down to New Hampshire to see an old friend. We hiked Mount Washington - I went barefoot - and exchanged stories in the backdrop of the White Mountains.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, I camped in the woods of Maine for five days while waiting for my friend Eszter to finish her remaining days at camp. There my demons emerged with staggering clarity. Insecurity, self-doubt, fear, loneliness &amp;ndash; they had settled themselves in the forefront of my being. Only when I accepted them as parts of me was I able to enjoy nature&amp;rsquo;s invitation to solitude and serenity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sitting on the crest of Seboeis Lake one night, I watched the clear water shimmer, and a growing sense of calm began to overtake me. My problems grew small, insignificant, and petty, fading altogether as the water reposed and sun descended. Silence took its hold and my perception of time disappeared. It was incredibly peaceful, and I started to cry and laugh out of sheer euphoria. My audience, an ensemble of crickets, cicadas and other creatures, echoed in unison under the starry sky. I had been invited to witness a crescendo of grand proportions, and nature was the composer. My loneliness, for a moment, was alleviated, and the words of Oliver Sacks rang through my mind: I, then and there, in the middle of an intimate intercourse with the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moments like these were rare. I recognized they were more likely to visit in conditions that allowed for total stillness. Should a person survive what initially feels like a trial by fire, this staggering state of loneliness, they emerge more alive and deeply in-tune with the world around them. Their capacity for love, understanding, and presence deepens. They become infinitely more capable. They are grateful to have been called back as cast members in the grand play of the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/lake.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;canada&#34;&gt;Canada&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I met Eszter in a canoe. Initially she seemed hesitant to tag along because she either didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to swim, or she couldn&amp;rsquo;t swim very well. Regardless, in an attempt to ease her concerned looks&amp;ndash;and probably to impress her&amp;ndash;I assured her that I had done this before, that she could trust me to take her safely across the vast Echo Lake. In truth, it was my first time ever commanding a canoe. Luckily for the both of us, it turned out to be a relatively easy task.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The summer air was pristine, the lake gleamed in the sunlight, loon calls echoed in the distance. It was a perfect afternoon. I took notice of Eszter&amp;rsquo;s dark eyes, her rough European accent, her curious necklace with a dragon hanging from it. She came from Hungary and worked in the Chef Camp program. We talked about nature and our place as humans in it, what life at camp was like, our lives outside of camp, U.S. consumerism, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t see each other again until weeks later. Camp kept us busy, I out on the lake and she in the corners of Chef Camp. A few days after I had decided to walk the Camino, she posted on the camp Facebook page that she was looking for people to go to Canada with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At that point I had developed a little crush on her, which, to me, seemed terribly irrational. She lived in Hungary, English wasn&amp;rsquo;t her native language, and I had no clue as to what I would be doing for the rest of the year. Regardless, the feelings were there, and I wanted to be in her company. What did I have to lose? At the very least, the trip would be fun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Later, we met and talked about the trip. We considered flying to Quebec and Montreal, but that meant I would&amp;rsquo;ve needed to find a place to store my car &amp;mdash;- more unnecessary expenditures. So I offered to drive instead. She looked at me with excited, bewildered eyes and said, in her rough Hungarian accent, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re going to fucking Canada!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/canada1.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In two days we drove from Maine to Quebec, from Quebec to Montreal, and from Montreal to Niagara Falls, with some detours to Ottawa and Cobourg in-between. Our friendship grew through the confluence of stupid jokes and cringy puns, camper stories, and Hungarian metal. She taught me Hungarian curse words and I taught her American colloquialisms. Stuff like &amp;ldquo;brooo, suhp duuude, liike, y&amp;rsquo;know.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What brought us close was our willingness to be vulnerable: we were open, honest, and non-judgmental in sharing our pasts, in telling each other our worst fears and deepest worries. We exchanged stories that possessed the capacity to destroy a person, secrets and thoughts that most people hide and bury in their psyches for eternity. Yet there we were, two people who were once complete strangers, attempting to piece together the incomplete shards of our disparate pasts, constructing the foundation of an enduring friendship.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In moments like these, I wanted to pull her close, wrap her in my arms, and tell her that everything would be fine&amp;ndash;that everything was fine, at least for the moment. That even if I did not fully understand her situation, I would always be there for her. That we, with our powers combined, could get through anything. That she was with me, the overly optimistic, boundlessly romantic, Phil.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We parted ways at Toronto Pearson International Airport. She was heading to Mexico, and I to Ohio. It was a bittersweet goodbye&amp;ndash;bitter because I have never been good at letting people go despite all of the practice I&amp;rsquo;ve had, sweet because I&amp;rsquo;d been lucky enough to have shared the journey with her.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;She told me, as we let one another out of our embrace, &amp;ldquo;Phil, it not a goodbye. It&amp;rsquo;s a see you later.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/canada2.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;departure-to-the-camino-september-05-2017&#34;&gt;Departure to the Camino: September 05, 2017&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I woke up in Boston on the cold, wooden floor of my friend&amp;rsquo;s apartment. It was his first day of graduate school, and my last in the U.S. for awhile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My only possessions were my 30 liter backpack, three sets of outfits, two books, a sleeping bag, my down jacket, a phone charger, toiletries, my boots, and a 12-pack of granola bars. My pack weighed no more than 10 lbs. The only thing left to prepare was my mind. I was jittery and nervous, but also incredibly excited.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I spent most of the morning in a coffee shop writing a letter to my friends:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My life on the move is far from over: tonight, I will fly to Europe to begin my journey on the Camino de Santiago, a 500 mile trek across Northern Spain. It will take me 33-35 days to complete. And while I intend to do it alone, it will not be a solitary experience; I expect to meet and travel with people of all ages and walks of life on the road to Santiago. The Camino is one of my lifelong goals, and the opportunity to do it could be no more prime than now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My motivations are simple: I want to see the world. I want to grow. I want to do something that scares the shit out of me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the pursuit of dreams, dreamers are met with several challenges. In my case, it was always figuring out what my next step was, dealing with the incessant self-doubt and fear that accompanies the process, and letting go of the attachments I developed with people, comfort, and calcified ideas that no longer served me. Such is the nature of walking the less trodden path. It&amp;rsquo;s unpaved, rocky, and dissuasive. If you don&amp;rsquo;t watch your step, you might just slip.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet, to quote Robert Frost, &amp;ldquo;[taking] the [road] less traveled by, / that has made all the difference&amp;rdquo;, the difference being a profound learning experience, a life lived on your own terms, a dream turned concrete reality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That, in a nutshell, is where I am going. You&amp;rsquo;ll know when I have made it across. Thanks for the love and support.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With Sincerity and Gratitude,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your friendly neighbor, Phil&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After posting the update to Facebook, I thought of my parents and the argument we had a few days prior about my decision to walk the Camino. They believed I was being reckless, that I should&amp;rsquo;ve taken the opportunity at Boston University. They believed that I, at the age of 24, should&amp;rsquo;ve had my life figured out. I felt like a disappointment, a terrible son. But this was the path I had decided to walk, and I needed them to know that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t backing out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wrote a journal entry expressing my frustrations:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;About the world, about my place,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;About where I belong&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this infinite space,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I sit at the margin, misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We collide and tear each other apart&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What ever happened to our graceful start?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I a child,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You unconditional.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want understanding &amp;ndash; I want love.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Forgive me and my trespasses&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I learn how to forgive myself&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And relearn to love you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then I wrote them a letter expressing how I felt. I sent it minutes before boarding the plane to Europe:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dear Mom and Dad,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the past twenty or so years, you have given me the best gift a child can ask for: your unconditional love. Despite our conflicts, despite our differences, despite the ever-growing physical distance between us, you have loved and supported me unflinchingly. Thank you for that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The worlds you and I grew up in could be no more different. I was born and raised in the safe and sunny suburbs of California; you in the dangerous aftermath of the Vietnam war. My childhood consisted of friendships, books, and video games; yours of rice fields, conflict, and uncertainty. Where I see possibility, you see risk. I struggle to know what&amp;rsquo;s next, who I will become; you struggled to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I understand why you might feel the way you do about the path I currently walk &amp;ndash; certainly scared, frustrated, saddened, uncomfortable, and maybe even disappointed. But know that you have raised a son who is strong, kind, independent, adventurous, curious, passionate, and happy. You have raised someone who isn&amp;rsquo;t afraid to chase after what he wants, after what he dreams of. Most importantly, you have taught me the meaning of compassion and kindness; that it isn&amp;rsquo;t always what we say that&amp;rsquo;s important, but what we do instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you ever meet the people I&amp;rsquo;ve had the fortune of developing relationships with, I think they would say I am an easygoing, thoughtful, caring, friendly, loyal, and loving person; that I would give them the shirt off of my back and the food on my table to make them feel loved and welcomed. I only have you two to thank for this. You have taught me to be a person of good character; you have given me the basic necessities for leading a fulfilled and meaningful life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, as I step out into the world and begin to draw my own map of it, I need your love more than ever. Because I will stumble and fall; I will get hurt and be heartbroken; I will be sad and frustrated and challenged beyond anything I have yet to face in my one and short life. But what&amp;rsquo;s life worth anyways if I don&amp;rsquo;t risk getting scratched and bruised along the way? That&amp;rsquo;s just a part of growing up; that&amp;rsquo;s how I have grown up; that&amp;rsquo;s how I want to grow up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re scared I won&amp;rsquo;t continue my &amp;ldquo;education&amp;rdquo;, don&amp;rsquo;t worry: my education has never been limited to the confines of a classroom. Life itself is the greatest teacher, and I am taught something new everyday.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you worry I am a loose-cannon with no bearings or a home: Home has never been about a location or house. Home is where you feel at home, and for me, that is when I am growing. I am currently expanding the home of my heart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whatever it is that drives me forward will continue to do so. That&amp;rsquo;s not to say this force is inflexible or incapable of change, but rather that I will not deviate from who I am and becoming. All I ask is for your continued love and acceptance of me. All of me. Not of who you wish me to be, but of who I already am.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I ask of myself to do the same. To accept and love you as you are and who you will become throughout time and eternity. I am endlessly grateful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Love,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your Son&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sending it was one of the hardest things I have ever done. I was petrified &amp;ndash; what would they say? Would they even understand? We weren&amp;rsquo;t a family that expressed our feelings so openly like this. It was always about the basics &amp;ndash; food, water, money, school, family.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But before boarding, my Mom left me with this message:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Philip, remember you will always be our son. I know you&amp;rsquo;re independent and want to do what you want, but always remember that. Me and your Dad will always support you, but know that I don&amp;rsquo;t feel happy about what you&amp;rsquo;re doing. I don&amp;rsquo;t feel good. I&amp;rsquo;m scared. Please stay safe. Keep us updated and send pictures. Your Dad and I love you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Heartbroken? Swelling with love? Check and check.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are we ever truly ready for the future? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. Life is too uncertain to always be prepared for it. But that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t deter us from living fully. Whether or not we have fun in the process is a choice. Me? I chose to dance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I boarded the plane, unsure of what was to come. In the air, I took one last look at the Boston skyline, the clouds pressed against the horizon. A brilliant swath of pinkish-orange hues left the sky ablaze.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Behind me stood home. Ahead, answers, perhaps, amid a foreign landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/shoes.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went downtown around 7 A.M. to get some coffee and start my work day. But just before arriving at the coffee shop, I notice a disheveled man standing beneath the hood of a closed restaurant. As I get closer I realize that he&amp;rsquo;s no more than a teenager. He has on a black backpack, a messy t-shirt, and faded jeans that barely fit his large frame. I get the impression that he hasn&amp;rsquo;t showered for some time judging from his dark greasy hair.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just another homeless guy, I think. I turn my gaze toward the coffee shop a few steps beyond him and walk.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before entering he asks if I have a dollar to spare for a drink.I reply with my instinctual, &amp;ldquo;Sorry, I don&amp;rsquo;t have any cash on me&amp;rdquo; and walk on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Ok. Sorry to bother you. Have a nice night then. I mean, day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I open the door, something compels me to look back at him. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what it is - his shivering, the fact that he was just a kid, or the guilt I felt for shrugging him off so easily - but I turn around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hey, I don&amp;rsquo;t have any cash, but I can buy you a drink with my card if you want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He quickly accepts my offer and we go inside.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I sit at my usual table and invite him to stay, though I notice that my guard is up despite any apparent threats to my own safety.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His hands are still shaking, shivering. His sleep-deprived eyes signal pain. He sits, and I ask him for his story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s 18, hardly an adult. His family is hooked on drugs. He&amp;rsquo;s never met his mom or sister, only knows that they&amp;rsquo;re in California, according to his dad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have many things in common: enjoyment of rap, educational values, even political views. He&amp;rsquo;s been reading at the local library and is trying to find a job to support himself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His uncle had kicked him out of the house two weeks ago. He&amp;rsquo;s had his own fair share of drug use, although he tells me he&amp;rsquo;s trying to get clean. He claims he&amp;rsquo;s dealing with a brain tumor and is not sure how much longer he&amp;rsquo;ll be around. He hands me his college ID card and insists that he was a student at the local community college, as if to prove to me the validity of his words and existence. He&amp;rsquo;s scared.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t care whether or not the whole story was a lie, but I was saddened by the truths radiating from his presence. He was just another human being struggling to make his way in this world, like me. Only I had been put in more fortunate circumstances. The only thing that differentiated us and our lives was the life lottery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m amazed that he is still able to sling a few jokes at me despite his situation. I laugh and we continue our conversation for the next hour.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is in our nature to marginalize and distance ourselves from people who seem different from us. Consciously I know it&amp;rsquo;s unjust. Yet my actions did not reflect this thought before chatting over coffee with the person mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was hard, initially, to just be &amp;lsquo;me&amp;rsquo; with him. It felt icky to shake his hand. I caught myself judging his past and prematurely concluding that his situation was a direct consequence of his actions. I had taken my own privilege for granted and failed to acknowledge him as another human being. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s easier to preach equality than it is to act in accordance with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, I think the cure to our unconscious, biased generalizations and categorization of people who are perceived as different from us is to constantly expose ourselves to and interact with a variety of people. We may realize in these moments that they are just like you and me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/gallery/bookspine.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
