    <h2>Graduate School</h2>
    <div class="post-date">February 13, 2020</div>
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>It&rsquo;s been a long process of deliberation, but I&rsquo;ve decided to attend graduate school at UVM.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t an easy decision. By the end of 2019 I felt incredibly burntout, mostly due to the fact that I had been taking two classes each semester in order to fulfill the math prerequisites, while also working full-time. I also had doubts about whether I actually wanted to do the program, which, when mixed with blind determination, makes for a deadly cocktail.</p>
<p>After winter break, I decided I wasn&rsquo;t going to take any more classes in the upcoming semester to recuperate and reflect. Since then I&rsquo;ve read, written, and journaled every day and have had extensive conversations with colleagues and friends. All of this lead me to the conclusion that I was trying to move through life too quickly. Even in the interim between the beginning of the semester and of a few weeks ago, I had applied for several jobs when I was supposed to be patiently reflecting. Luckily my gut knew that this was not what I wanted. All I needed was a breath of fresh air, a break from my own tumult.</p>
<p>With my mental in a better place, I was able to make an intentional decision, one free from any external pressure or momentum, one that was aligned with both my head and my heart. I promised myself that I would take things more slowly, even if it meant being in school longer, which isn&rsquo;t so bad all things considered: I can focus on deeply learning the material by spreading my studies out across 3 years instead of 2, and I can continue working full-time, which means tuition will be covered. And I have more reason to stay in the beautiful VT.</p>
<p>In regards to my desire to help others in a meaningful way, that is something I am still figuring out. It&rsquo;s certainly possible to steer my graduate efforts toward that end, but as for the specifics, I&rsquo;m not sure yet as to how. As flight attendants so dutifully remind us during takeoff: I must first put on my own oxygen mask before I can be of service to others. That is something I am still learning. For now I hope my writing serves that purpose. I know for me it certainly has.</p>
