Hello! Iâ€™m Phil. 

By day I work as a research analyst at OHSU. I like the R programming language and making things. Anything that has an element of hands-on tinkering (poetry, coding, playing guitar) is my jam.

By night you can find me reading, writing, noodling on the guitar, practicing handstands, or taking long walks with no particular destination in mind. 

In several past lives I was a breakdancer, jump roper, slackliner, roller skater, and gamer. I enjoy doing math sometimes, and I am a big meditation enthusiast and practitioner (Dzog'chen is my preferred jam). 

If you feel inclined to chat with me about life, your work, and other miscellanea, feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://x.com/NguyenHPhil) or at nguy (dot) philip (at) gmail. I currently live in NYC and would love to connect with curious and kind people!
