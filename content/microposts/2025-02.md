A video ([Sad Girl Days Are Over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPQ5f4XRVZc)) I need to watch over and over again. The density of goodness in this is so high. "I don't think there's a choice to not be sad, but there is a choice to be happy."

A relevant comment: "You know whats weird? Alot of the time, I'll end up THINKING that im miserable. Thinking of bad memories etc... but then i ask myself how i feel. (I end up having to ask myself that because i actually tend to ignore my emotions) And when i focus on how i actually FEEL rather than my thoughts. I realize Im actually comfortable and perfectly happy. The bad 'feelings' were coming from my thoughts and not my feelings."
