I finally made the time to interview my parents about growing up in Vietnam, escaping the aftermath of the war, becoming a refugee, and starting a new life in America. 

Their stories are ones of finding meaning in loss, reconfigurations of identity, and leaps of faith. They are stories of the human spirit at work, and of gracious serendipity. Their stories keep my own in perspective.
