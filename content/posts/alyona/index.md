This is Alyona (and I).

We began writing letters to each other over a year ago toward the end of 2018. She was studying in Russia at the time and had dreams of one day visiting America.

Of course, I told her if she did come that we would have to meet, but neither of us anticipated the day would come so soon; a few months later she was accepted to study in the U.S. through the YEAR Program.

Fast forward several more months and here we are in Boston, two individuals who share an endless fascination with the human experience, two curious souls with a desire to seize all the moments.

Only later did we learn that perhaps it is the moments that seize us.
