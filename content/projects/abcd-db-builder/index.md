This is an app I built in Shiny to help ABCD Researchers download ABCD datasets (Unfortunately I can't show the app due to confidentiality, but the source code is [here.](https://github.com/nguyenhphilip/ABCD_Database_Builder))

Here is a GIF demonstrating some of the app's functionality.

You can select which spreadsheet(s) you want to download, specific variables from the spreadsheets, which visits to include, and what to name your file.
