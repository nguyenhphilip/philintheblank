This is a brief project where I look at mental health symptom networks in a large sample of youth from the [ABCD Study](https://abcdstudy.org/) for the course [Principles of Complex Systems](https://pdodds.w3.uvm.edu/teaching/courses/2021-2022principles-of-complex-systems/). I was largely inspired by the work being done by [Denny Borsboom](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.20375) and [company](http://psychosystems.org/NetworkSchool) using network analysis to study mental health. There is still a lot of work to do, but the report for the class can be found [here](https://github.com/nguyenhphilip/pocs-mh-nets/blob/main/CSYS_Mental_Health_Networks.pdf).

Check out [this awesome paper](https://psyarxiv.com/f68ej/) for more on applying complex systems thinking to psychopathology!
