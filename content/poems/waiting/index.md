The news came over you
the way winter

does, like a wave crawling
up your spine,

every goosebump a sign
that the story

you lived by would soon
come to its

end. The fire warming
your heart makes

way for the embers
and ashes,

for all that’s left, black
scars and burn

marks, a house without
a roof, memories

forever frozen
in place. You’ll

Know he’s gone when
the silence

settles like
dust.
