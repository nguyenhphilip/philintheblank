In stillness Québec flowers.
Like the first shot of espresso
or your last kiss of the morning
and perhaps even after 
a perfectly placed line-break, 
its flavor rolls and multiples,
grows and expands 
the way words and sentences 
do over full-stops and commas, 
the longer you linger. 
So linger a little longer. 
Come to the realization 
that tourists and citizens 
are all the same 
when they meet your gaze
at the windowpane. 
Listen to how the children speak 
in footsteps and foreign tongues
and still find each other. 
Notice how even grief 
is content to waif and flâneur 
along the cobble-covered streets.
Later, when you're meeting someone
for the first time and their hands 
are already all over you,
convincing you that 
*You are a silly American*
*and this is how we will bridge*
*the distance of language,*
you are ready to surrender.
Later, when you're mouthing
your goodbyes at the bus stop,
you are ready to depart.
