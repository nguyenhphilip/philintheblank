Hold on. Forget
to have have fun. Rerun
every kiss you ever held
like tomorrow won't come.

Watch the sun paint the sky
in thankless strokes. Let your mind
play roulette with all your hopes.
Tell yourself you have to do this
alone. Remind yourself
you'll never find yourself
and your way back home.

Don't confess what a mess
you are. Count your sins
and every scar. Convince
yourself you still want
what you don't want
and let the Myrtle tree out front
shed her pink dress
without the lonely eyes
of her only witness.
