**_I. Summer of COVID-19_**

This time around
the antagonist is a consequence

of randomness
and stupidity;

Not the usual trail of mosquito bites
lining my ankles after a night by the lake–

Not the flakey crust of sunburned shoulders
and sun-spoiled cider roiling in the drunk sand–

Not the hurried kiss of a summer love
meant to be a memory–

No instead I am accompanied by an unfounded certainty,
a future I cannot yet begin to imagine

without compromising the numerous stitches
already upholding the architecture

of a life once mine.

**_II. In the Dark_**

Oscillating between

despair and
restlessness;

newsfeeds
and skin–

poems and
music;

pasts and
a reality

running from reach.

**_III. Falling_**

Your face in the bathroom mirror
again staring back at someone
something unknowable
wondering how long
it takes for regret
to leave
the
body

**_IV. How_**

To move forward?

To get over myself?

To save myself

when I myself

lack myself

the smiling

confidence

of an untouched life?

**_V. Kintsugi_**

Begin with love
and generous fingertips,
yours. Lace the roiled sand
between the cracks
and piece together
the moments
one by one.
Hold them still
as if your life
depended on
it–it does–
and wait.
Growth requires
time. Meaning
demands patience.
