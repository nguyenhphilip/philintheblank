God’s knocking at the bedroom door
again. You redress yourself in reason
but the devilish grin isn’t coming off
as easily as before.
You tell me we’re pushing it,
you say we asked for forgiveness
last time. But I remind you
that he’s a professional,
that we keep him in business
by asking over and over
and over again.
