Twiggy spider
on my yoga mat
thank you for undoing
the past hour
of self folding
and holding with your
unannounced appearance.
I know
you've been watching
and have suggestions
for how
I carry my body.
After all I have
a thousand times
the neurons and only
a fraction
of your intention
and grace.
You walk on eight
stilettos and still
men like me
chase beauty
and women
and forget
you exist.
But we get each other.
We're foreign
to  ourselves
but not strangers.
We give
birth
and die.
And in
the in-between
we weave
and cradle
worlds
with our extremities.
We might even
for a second
acknowledge
the other
in passing:
I a moving
mountain,
You a pebble
who has seen
it all
from your
small corner
of the world.
