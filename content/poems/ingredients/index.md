One pinch of fun, just enough for two.
Two cups of trust – three for the adventurous.
Four cloves of love – more for good measure.
Five pounds of respect to ensure a firm foundation.
Six licks to taste, just in case things turn sour.
Eight hints of promises, so seven can be broken.
Nine gallons of luck, Papa said,
because life always get messy.
Ten drops of honey, to top things off.
