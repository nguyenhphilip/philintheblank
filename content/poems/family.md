One day you called,
your voice full
 
of sadness and the weight
of a history unknown to me.
 
In the back of your throat
it had found a place to live
 
like an allergen too familiar
with avoidance. Dad’s phở
 
could cure anything.
It stewed of meat and bone.
 
But it knew nothing
of distance and blood.
 
I learned this too late
choking on words
 
across the country, trying
to support you, years later.
 
It was your decision:
You and mom weren’t talking
 
anymore. I thought of her then,
alone, in front of the TV at the end
 
of the day, always on,
weekends too, and Dad,
 
hiding in the garage,
fixing audio devices.
 
Once the war was over
no one knew what to do
 
so we went to war
with one another instead.
 
This time it felt like
the right time to fire
 
and listen
