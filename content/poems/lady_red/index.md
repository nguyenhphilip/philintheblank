While the yellow-jackets mingle with
the Azaleas and the sunflowers
and the people with only each other,
You were there in the sky
on a young branch navigating
the heights of which
far too few have seen,
crawling toward the sun.
You weaved through the leaves
and fought against the voice of Mother,
and finally, finally,
you reached the peak.
Then, just like the robins,
just like the timid sparrows
singing without the need for recognition,
you opened the crimson shell
housing your weightless wings
and flew to the only place you knew
was home.
