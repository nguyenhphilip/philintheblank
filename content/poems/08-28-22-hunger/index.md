You’re a painting
You’re a body of photographs
framed in a movie reel –

You’re music
You’re a guitar that sings
on love-stained strings –

You’re something to behold
a rose never to touch
a smile just for show –

Does the hunger ever end?
even in romance and pretense
even in more-than-just–friends –

You’re poetry
You’re heaved sonnets to a delicate love song–
An Oliver and a Dickinson

in a world that wants
Cummings
and Nerudas –

You are freedom
You are madness kissed
You are fires to a spark –

You are distance
You are desire
You are the reason I walk –

There I go
yearning
screaming –

running
