Will you start the day now?
Time can only cradle you
for so long, your body so
heavy with duty and obligation.

The questions tugging at your soul
can wait; she will be there
at the end of the day, and if not
perhaps tomorrow â€“ well at least
you have yourself.

And if not that, well,
time will be waiting,
poised like the sliver of a grin,
ready to swing your life away.
