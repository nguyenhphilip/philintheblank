Two birds in unison along a grayed shore walking
and squawking like inseparable twins

Talking and squealing in that terrifying tongue
only they can understand,

Mocking our efforts to tame the unknown, laughing
because we canâ€™t in the face of uncertainty.

But for all our differences, I was reassured to find
that they shit

In much the same way
we do.
