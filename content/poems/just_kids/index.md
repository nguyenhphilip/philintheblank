I’m sailing,
I’m drifting on
a rusty boat
in open sea
heading nowhere
and everywhere
like birch seeds floating
on the warm breath
of a Vermont summer,
searching for a place
to land and settle,
an identity to inhabit
and call my own.

It’s a story I can’t get over, mine,
this collection of half-finished poems
full of half-hearted lines
that sketch the color of my thoughts.
Answers are supposed to help
but the questions
are quicker to rise.

Still, beneath the sail
lies the redeeming oar.
Grab it and propel yourself forward
into the winds of opportunity,
and when the storm inevitably comes
as it always does
ride the waves
and soar above
the tempests that seek
to cloud the light
bursting from your heart.
