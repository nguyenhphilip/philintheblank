One moment I’m a philosopher, all words
and fat with truth. The next I’m a poet
moonlighting for something new to say.
I’ve tried on the certainty of equations
since they promised me the last word.
But I liked the birds instead, every word
of theirs a spell that guarantees
the truth of my existence,
that truths are truisms
only sometimes true,
that Truth itself lies
within and beyond
what can be said
and has been said
with words.
