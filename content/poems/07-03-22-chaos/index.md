I hold the world
In a single equation.

*Donâ€™t forget to express the bifurcations.*

A flap in the wind
A sudden change of heart
I have accounted for
every unknown start.

*But what of love and culture*
*And romance too?*

It is all certain
In the limit of time.

*But until then*
*what do you believe*

*that we will do?*
