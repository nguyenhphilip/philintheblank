How beautiful it is
that landlocked bodies
of water will find
their way to the ocean
through crevasses
no one else can see.
That something as light
as wind can carry
the heaviness of traveled waves
for miles through miles
of emptiness and longing
to distant shorelines
where at last they may find
a witness to their journey.
*Rest and stay awhile*, he says,
*the sand is warm, the sun a friend.*
*Tell me the story of how you found*
*your way through the cracks. Show me*
*how you pieced yourself together*
*and dared the great escape.*
