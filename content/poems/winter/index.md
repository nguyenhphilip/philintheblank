A season between seasons
a bridge crossed by the plentiful few,
Adults seek it endlessly
though already the children knew.

Don’t bother with asking ––
we’re sworn to secrecy.
I myself have nothing to say
though clues are not certainties:

Between one breath of Winter
and one sigh of Spring,
go to where the avians
dare to fly and sing.
