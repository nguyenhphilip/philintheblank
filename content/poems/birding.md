Itâ€™s not all that different
from living well. Go slow.
Leave your labels at home.
Sit in the unknown
and let the silence speak.
 
Wait. Wait a little longer. Wait
until you remember: a thing
can travel everywhere, just by holding
still.
 
Clear that from your mind.
Forget the existence of time.
You have all day which is
to say a lifetime.
 
Listen. Look. Look
again until you see
nothing is everything,
everything in nothing.
 
Let everything find you.
Let every thing sing its song.
In the songs, a sky.
In the sky, a word.
