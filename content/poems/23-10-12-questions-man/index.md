How's a man supposed to feel when
he lives for nothing more than ends?
His circumstances pull him one way
yet something else demands.

Is he honoring the call?
Is he ready to let go and fall
so that he can be caught
by forces he's long forgot?
To really feel in his bones
that he was never in fact alone?

He's got money, he's got time, so why
does he yearn for the sublime?

And when did it become so important
to be right?
When did his life turn into
a series of fights

against the man in the mirror? 
How did fear
replace love?
When did the glove
become life itself?

Is it possible to change
while keeping everything
the same? To hold what
is no longer his 
without setting himself 
aflame?

Does he need his light
to dwell in the dark?
Can he put out the flame
and follow his heart?
