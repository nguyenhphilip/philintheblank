I woke up at 5am to make my roommate breakfast because it’s her first day of school as a teacher. Afterwards I couldn’t fall back asleep and began instead to listen to the early morning. It’s a pleasant if not unerring space to be in. It’s just you and the slowness of the hour, held by an awareness of the moment, steeping in the water of creation, wherein the mind remains quiet and ripe. Here nothing is asked of you except, perhaps, to listen.

The sound of a cricket and the no-sound
of absence. No sense not nonsense,
only the hushed humming of morning.
Morning, still with dust in its eyes,
darkness, wrapping up its shift.
The birds have begun to rehearse
while the dead mourn their last drink.
Thoughts piercing the veil of dreams,
shadows creeping over the landscape.
The movement of water 
through pipes and the air unseen.
My existence made known
in the quiet clattering of keys.
Streams of consciousness
louder than the Winooski river.
A lonely crow echoing
in the distance.
