the child inside me yearns
for something more–
a clue, perhaps, a sign,
another open door–

the white walls surrounding me
are falling like wavering petals–
the world says keep them up,
Why can't you just Settle?

My restless mind looks through
the windowsill and begs
for the world outside–
Go, now, it whispers,
there is nothing here
left to hide.

Be bold. Be brave.
Put on a straight face
and take the leap –
what opportunities missed
when fear runs deep.
