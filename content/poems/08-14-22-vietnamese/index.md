At the age of two I learned
of loss and shadows, how both
can exist without the light.
You always had to be
two steps ahead Dad said
if you wanted to survive.
Stories that were never mine
I carried anyways, one part
the past I inherited, the rest
a future that had no use for dreams
and romance. Home
was no longer a roof
but instead a hunger longing
for something more than history.
