There I threw my sorrows
in hopes that they would stay.
Instead you returned tomorrow
with the weight of yesterday.

Forgive me for asking twice,
I've already begged in prayerâ€“
He returned a palm full of ice,
a reminder that life isn't fair.

The crows made their sighs
and the sunflowers bowed,
I screamed shouted and cried
while you stood indifferent and proud.

The grass gleamed with dew
as I endured the cold pain,
while the earth smiled, renewed,
and thanked me for the rain.
