Find a place to rest now. Sit.
Close your eyes â€“ yes, things will be fine.
Breathe. Let go, for a moment,
of worry. Don't worry: he'll be waiting
for you when you open your eyes.
For now release. Sink in. Breathe again.
Feel the cold beneath your feet.
Feel the hug of the rising sun.
Notice how something as thin as grass
can hold the weight of the world.
Notice how something as light as air
can carry the dramas of civilization.
Watch your thoughts come and go like clouds.
Let time slow down. Let space be space.
And breathe again.
Listen to the silence.
Listen to the sound of your beating heart.
Hear the rhythms of existence ebb and flow
erratically between your life and this life.
Open your eyes when you're ready
and let worry in
like an old friend.
