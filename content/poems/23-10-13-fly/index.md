Curious fly
with your 
thousand 
eyes,
what is it 
that you see
in me? &nbsp; Today
I am &nbsp; &nbsp; your flower
and you are &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;my bee
because &nbsp; it seems
you can’t get
enough &nbsp; of me.
Have I forgotten
to wash
this &nbsp; &nbsp; and that
patch &nbsp; &nbsp; of skin?
Or were &nbsp; &nbsp; you meant
to &nbsp; light 
the night	within?
I want &nbsp; &nbsp; to crush you
	with my hand.
I want &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to map you
with my &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; words	
and hopeless plans.
You are Plato’s &nbsp; &nbsp; Ideal
that which cannot
be &nbsp; touched.
Perhaps &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then
between you
and &nbsp; &nbsp; me
this
is enough.
