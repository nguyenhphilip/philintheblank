Love is a loaded gun
In certain hands.
Don’t hesitate now
Go make your demands.
My arms are up yes
So claim what you see.
In your crosshair my heart
upon a sleeve.
I confess I’m a threat
To everything you know.
But don’t worry I’ll dance
With you real slow.
What’s the rush you’re in
Such a hurry.
My questions lack answers
But it’s a lifelong journey.
Shoot if you have to
And say it was for love.
What you would die for
Is a taste of this blood.
