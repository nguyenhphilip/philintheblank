There goes the body again
trying to find answers
where only questions exist.

Where do we go from here?
Why does hope feel so heavy?
Who am I without love and direction?

Rilke said to live
the questions, as if
by following the curves

of their bodies
you would be led
to the full-stop of your life.

Of course,
everyone has their answers
and I am still here

writing of curves and bodies.
Such is life they say.
Did Rilke live his?
