I.

In the riptide
&emsp; &emsp; of
&emsp; &emsp; this moment
may I act out of &emsp;	goodwill,
may I rediscover
the goodness &emsp; of others
&emsp; &emsp; made obfuscate
by timelines &emsp; &emsp; and party lines
&emsp; &emsp; and tighten the loosened thread
that ties us all
&emsp; together.

II.

The gift is knowing
what ails you

the privilege is holding &emsp; &emsp;	that truth
without turning &emsp; away–

what I fear most is not that you will hurt me
because in many ways you already have
but that I may never understand	&emsp; why

III.

&emsp; &emsp; What I fear
most is not that &emsp;	my side is losing
but that we
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; are lost.

IV.

May I summon &emsp;	the courage to speak
&emsp; &emsp; not out of &emsp; hate &emsp; or righteousness
not out of the pain	&emsp; I’ve held for so long
both for myself &emsp;	and for others,

but with the soft palpitations of a heart
&emsp; &emsp; in search of redemption,
&emsp; with the hushed voice of a nation
&emsp; &emsp; dying for reconciliation.

V.

May our differences
sharpen our similarities.

May I be bold enough
to witness your suffering

and subsequently illuminate
the shape of my own.

May we surf the edges with evermore grace
so that we can rise above the inevitable tide,

swim ashore and dance
to the drumming of a fragile anthem

celebrating
the birth of a nation.
