older
and still no closer
to heaven. But please,
leave me–

Leave me here where
my prayers are answered
in the rhyme of a Dickinson
or the riff of a Sultana–

Leave me here on the breast
of the earth where angels
kiss sinners like me
over tea and late night memories
on Sunday mornings–

Leave me here where the blessing
of caressing hands is enough
to bend a celibate to his knees
over the pulpit of her body
as they mouth Hallelujah–

Leave me here alone
in the bedroom of midnight
so I may wake drenched
in the sweat of stars
and surrendered dreams–

Leave me here where salvation
can be found on a coastline
under hails of light bursting
through the winged cathedral
of a redwood canopy–

Leave me here where the mind
is wider than the sky
and contains so much
more
than I–

Leave me here
and heaven forbid
the day I arrive
at the holy promenade
without my return ticket–

Leave me here
to dwell in possibility–

–in the only promise
guaranteed.
