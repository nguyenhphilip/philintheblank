Winter stripped you of your Colors
and left you standing – Naked –
without so much as a kiss

while the two lovers climbed your branches
and celebrated together
all that they would miss.

They declared their Love
with their crooked names
on your soft bark–

"For you," they whispered,
as you smiled above, no longer lonely
in the afternoon dark.
