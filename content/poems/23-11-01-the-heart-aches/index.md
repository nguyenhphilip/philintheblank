The heart aches
for what the mind wants.
Not smart enough, nowhere close 
to enlightened, a hungry snail who thinks 
himself a cat, always searching,
always on the verge of something, 
unable to anticipate every variable 
unknown. In the end
the heart takes him in, 
wraps him up in her 
boundless forgiveness
knowing that puzzles
are the opiate of the restless.
She's had the answers
all along and reminds him 
as he twists and agonizes
in his sleep until sunrise, when again
he rides off toward the light,
coat fully unbuttoned, searching
for shadows on roads 
that lead him
back to the beginning.
