They asked for his time,
not how he got here.
Let me wonder then:

Did he stumble?
Did his body crumble
at all like
a soggy crepe
held up by sticks
on his way
to some
pre-determined
somewhere?

Or did he bumble
like a bee, all grace
& no trace of
a single step,
every toe kissing
the asphalt
as if it were
dirt?

The numbers reveal
one thing while hiding
everything else.
