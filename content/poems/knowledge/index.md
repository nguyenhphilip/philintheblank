She sits in her lab
with a handful of instruments
and a head full of clues.
Surrounding her are guesses,
and things she already knew.
If only she could see it,
if only she could understand
how it all fits together
in the grand master plan.
The past always resolves the future,
so she's learned,
in the present of her time,
but still, she feels,
There is so much left to find,
there is still so much to know.
