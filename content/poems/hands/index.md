Look at what all these years
have done to your hands.
The hands of a man
born on two shorelines,
the hands of an artist
and engineer who makes knives
pirouette on stained bamboo boards.
You still season the chicken
with ginger and sarcasm,
and your pho reminds us
that all love needs
is bones and water.
I've tried writing the steps
down, but what recipe
could ever contain you?
Who could hope to recreate
what you have touched?
God has made his attempts,
but the angel you once held
wants nothing more
than your hands again.
