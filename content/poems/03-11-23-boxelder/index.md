Like life, you kept finding your way through my
walls despite how many times I squished you
nudged you onto paper mail to leave you
out in the harsh winter air, where confused
you wondered what happened to the warmth of
a home that once housed your black-red body.
You looked at me with curiosity
the other day as I was about to
sweep you away. You crawled along the top
of my couch, and when I approached you turned
your body, antennae, and zigzagged legs
at me as if you knew what was coming.
In a funny way you give my days shape
consistency in my daily motions
meaning I am not creative in how
I get rid of you from my empty flat
always with guilt and a pinch of remorse
because you are there during lonely nights
in the vents, hiding in the windowsill,
always available like morning light
to spring me from my longing, to wake me
into something just beyond the outline
of my well-known interiorities.
