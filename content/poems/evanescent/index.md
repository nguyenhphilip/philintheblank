so many years left
by the measure of things

though memory and circumstance
don’t seem to agree with me.

they only see
the distance

between who we were then
and who we are now.

i can’t tell if you’re smiling
or if that’s the wrinkle

in your eye
reminding me

of where we’ve been
and where we’re still going.

there’s not much
of that for us anymore,

we’ve had our fair share
of looking ahead,

but you’re still surprised
when you find my fingers

in the thicket of your silver threads,
grazing on skin

now deliciously peppered
with time.
