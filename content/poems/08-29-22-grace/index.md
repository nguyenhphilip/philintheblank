count the possibilities
on your toes this time,
as if they were suddenly
released from the grip
of boots too small
for feet meant to kiss the earth.
Walk until your feet need rest
and rest. Worry for awhile
and let the sand remind you
of rocks and change. Then
go and find yourself
on the other side of the shore
where love always fits
in places it once couldnâ€™t.
