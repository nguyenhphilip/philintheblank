When someone dies
are they really gone?

The apples in the garden
miss your callused touch,

and the Earth, it seems,
can't weep enough.

Forever feels
more real

than the rain does.
You're gone

but the story
lives on

in a bed
of neurons

you once said,
electrical impulses

with enough power
to light

entire universes.
I wish you were here

but you are there
where stars like you

are meant to burn
like diamonds studded

in the sky,
your bright

presence
forever my light.
