There is always the trace of you
in these places we once called ours.
I'm here again today and
now they're only mine and yours.

I come from time to time
just to see if things have changed.
Not much has
though there's a new couch now.

And there is still
that familiar knot
in the butter of this biscuit
as savory as our kisses were.

My coffee is still dark
like the blades of your eyes,
your rooibos tea now
a touch lighter than mine.

I'm here to find
what only I can see.
What you always saw,
what I simply perceived.

I'm stronger this time
but I still bend like your smile.
The new couch is staring at me
and I'm wondering what is right.
