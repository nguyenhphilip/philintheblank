You didn’t text me on my birthday.
I know I know, I walked away
but you asked if you could
even when everything was breaking
between us in that burning room and now
I’m breaking and thought you would
save me, like you always did. But still,
perhaps, you knew, like you always did,
what my heart needed most, and gave that
to me instead. You, the better put-together half,
are still saving me, even after all this time.
