it’s just the two of us now.
What more is there to say?
Besides, there are dishes
to do, chairs and tables 
to dust and rearrange.
Oh but this you say,
this is what you’ve been
waiting for? You're hopeless.
Didn’t you see Sherry?
Those pants! Way too tight,
gripped her body
like a banana peel. 
And Tom, oh Tom, 
his starving eyes,
grazing over her like a wolf.
They’d be a mess together.
Really? What a warped notion
of beauty you have.
It’s not that funny
that I notice these things.
And look—you missed a spot.
Yes, here. Open your eyes.
And about Sherry
and Tom—I’d never tell them
what I said, of course. 
It’s all hypothetical, dear. 
When does love enter
the picture? 
Don’t get so sentimental.
It always finds
a way, dear, 
it always does.
