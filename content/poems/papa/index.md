Hunched over in your garden
like a daylily on the boardwalk watching
the world spin faster
and faster on its slant axis,
you still water the plants we bought for you
three summers ago, as if
you were still showering us
with your wordless love,
with your thankless devotion,
praying one day that
we will eventually grow
back in your direction.
