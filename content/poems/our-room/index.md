Pens and paintbrushes
scattered on the bathroom floor.
Half-finished poems
and crooked photos
line the chipping walls.
In the dark corners our two desks rest.
The candles are beyond extinguished,
our eyesight isn't the best.
Loved ones tell us they're concerned,
they say we need something different,
but we can still see
that we already have
All we can dream of
and more.
