Sometimes a rhyme is good.
Avoid all shrouds and sometimes
repetition too. Subtract words
as needed, maybe all of them.
Keep one ear close to the page
and listen

to the heartbeat

of every word, every space,
every line; see how lines
define
and break
and keep steady the pace
of a poem. And remember that
heart is at the center of it all.
