Like a berry hanging from a vine
that’s the first sign, according to
the experts. But you didn’t know it
then: back in Vietnam fruit grew 
on trees and bushes. It didn’t hide
and rupture like cherries too ripe
inside your wife’s head. 

Even war has its starts, its survivors.
All you got was a thud and a body
choking on itself. That was when
sister and I became refugees, too.

One day we told you we saw her,
going elsewhere. At last, when you
looked, you found her picking fruit
in familiar fields, welcoming you home.
