In the nook of this morning
there is the urge for busyness
and meaning. But the golden
has just hopped between
two humans musing
about the sun. How difficult,
she thinks, to be so thoughtful.
Her neck cranes downward
toward the dirty floorboards
takes a whiff
of what is missing
and suddenly remembers
the shape of dirt.
