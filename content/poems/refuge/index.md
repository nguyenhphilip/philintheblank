Find refuge in my Harbor
the water Here is clear,
The Storm is over now
Rest easy now, my Dear.

Let your Anchor reach
the depths of my Sea,
Let it Sink with Time
while you set yourself Free.

Strip the worn Sails
and cast them to new Hands,
Let them taste again
the Salt of warm Sands.

Turn the Whites into Doves
that soar the open sky,
Turn the Kites into Loves
who Fly you through Night.
